class='gsl-title'>3,434 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Originally a
piano based blues/jazz instrumental style. It was first recorded during the
1920s so should not be applied to any earlier recordings. There is some
debate about which was the earlest boogie recording, but certainly Pine Top
Smith was an early exponent of this style. His 1928 recording
&#8220;Pinetop&#8217;s Boogie Boogie&#8221; is generally regarded as the
first use of the term. There was a boogie woogie &#8220;craze&#8221; during
the late 1930s which saw the style become widely popular and many classic
recordings were made at this time (notable performers include Albert Ammons,
Pete Johnson and Meade &#8220;Lux&#8221; Lewis).

During the 1930s boogie woogie also started to influence other styles of
music including big band and country, and many big band and country boogie
instrumentals were recorded. During the 1940s the influence of boogie woogie
extended further into rhythm &#038; blues and gospel.</span></li>

blues is a genre of blues music that developed in the period after World War
II in the state of Louisiana. It is generally divided into two major
subgenres, with the jazz-influenced New Orleans blues based on the musical
traditions of that city and the slower tempo swamp blues incorporating
influences from zydeco and Cajun music from around Baton Rouge.[1] Major
artists in the New Orleans tradition include Professor Longhair and Guitar
Slim and for swamp blues Slim Harpo and Lightnin&#8217; Slim. Both genres
peaked in popularity in the 1960s and were covered by a number of rock
artists. Interest declined in the later 1960s but there have been occasional
revivals since the 1970s.</span></li>

Impressionist
The term &#8220;Impressionist&#8221; was first coined in the mid-1870s, as a
critically derisive term, of the light- and color-focused paintings of a
small band of Paris-based artists, the so-called &#8220;Salon des
Refusés&#8221; (Salon of the Refused) &#8211; among them Manet, Renoir,
Degas, and especially Monet, whose &#8220;Impression, soleil levant&#8221;
inspired the name. The application of the term to music, from the 1880s, was
a rather predictable extension, though most composers to whom it was applied
renounced its application &#8211; most famously Claude Debussy, who claimed
that those critics who apply it to music are &#8220;imbeciles&#8221;, and
that instead he is simply trying to do &#8220;something different.&#8221;

Their protestations notwithstanding, however, there are indeed aesthetic and
technical corollaries between visual and musical &#8220;impressionism&#8221;
that can be identified empirically. Most prominent is the notion of
&#8220;color&#8221;. In music, the more conventional term is
&#8220;timbre&#8221;, which is defined largely through orchestration, but
likewise through harmonic usage, texture, etc. Creative exploration of
musical timbre via orchestration certainly predates the Impressionist
period, but it was especially this generation that opened up timbre as a
first-tier parameter, to be exploited and pursued in its own right. In
orchestral works such as Debussy&#8217;s La Mer or Maurice Ravel&#8217;s
Daphnis et Chloé, unusual usage or combinations of instruments, particularly
at soft dynamic levels, are a common feature and give the works a distinctly
&#8220;coloristic&#8221; sound, that would open up new possibilities to
later composers. Even in works for solo piano &#8211; such as
Debussy&#8217;s Preludes &#8211; new timbres are explored via extremes of
register, as well as by unique and &#8220;colorful&#8221; approaches to
harmony and melody. Indeed, it is in the realm of harmony that the
Impressionist &#8220;sound&#8221; is most readily identified: via such
techniques as parallel triads, whole-tone scales, blurring of tonal
identity, extended or chromatic chords (9ths, 11ths, 13ths), etc. Another
corollary between music and painting can be discerned in their mutual
fascination with certain &#8220;impressionist&#8221; themes or topics
&#8211; such as water, reflection, reverie, etc. More generally, though,
artists in both fields were motivated by a desire to break down old
conventions in order to explore new methods and techniques; in music this
meant turning away from the Romantic-Germanic emphasis on traditional
large-scale forms, thematic unity, and development, in favor of smaller,
individual forms and work-specific techniques.

Beyond the giants of the Impressionist period, Debussy and Ravel, other
figures associated with the movement include the French composers Erik Satie
and Paul Dukas, the Spaniard Manuel de Falla, and the American Charles
Griffes, as well as &#8211; to some degree at least &#8211; Karol
Szymanowski, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frederick Delius, and Ottavino
Resphigi. Among composers hailed as precursors or inspirations to later
Impressionist developments include especially Modest Mussorgsky, Alexander
Scriabin, and Gabriel Fauré, as well as Emmanuel Chabrier and César Franck.
Further, Impressionist techniques and sonorities had resurgence among Jazz
composers and performers such as Bix Biederbecke, Bill Evans, Gil Evans, and
Duke Ellington. Above all, the Impressionist musical language, techniques,
and aesthetic had a direct and profound influence on the revolutionary
Modern period that followed.

is a subgenre of Dark Wave music that emerged in the early to mid-1980s in
the UK. It is characterized by a classical approach based on acoustic
instrumentation and electronic sound simulation, often generated by
synthesizers and samplers.

In the early 1980s, numerous Post-Punk bands showed an interest in art music
and classical music but couldn&#8217;t achieve the necessary technical
proficiency. At the time, Venomettes members Viginia Hewes, Anne Stephenson,
and Martin McCarrick − who graduated from Royal College of Music and
Guildhall School of Music and Drama − became influential figures of the
British Post-Punk and New Wave scene and started working with a variety of
seminal artists, including The Cure, The Glove, Siouxsie and the Banshees,
Anne Clark, Marc Almond, This Mortal Coil, Virginia Astley, Peter Murphy,
Sex Gang Children, Virgin Prunes, and Skin. The inclusion of traditional
music instruments, especially chordophones such as violin, cello, and piano,
became a standard for many 1980s Dark Wave productions.

Shortly afterwards, UK-based post-punk acts Dead Can Dance and In the
Nursery abandoned conventional rock structures in favour of instrumentation,
sound simulation, and compositional techniques associated with classical
music and film scores, and produced a range of essential full-length
works.</span></li>

Bassline Wikipedia page] Bassline (sometimes referred to as bassline house,
organ house, Niche or 4&#215;4) is a type of music related to UK garage that
originated in Sheffield in the early 2000s. Stylistically it comprises a
four-to-the-floor rhythm normally at around 135–142 beats per minute, a
strong emphasis on bass, and a pop music aesthetic similar to that of its
precursor 2-step garage.

In the scene&#8217;s early days the most prominent bassline club was the
Niche nightclub in Sheffield, which became at the centre of controversy due
to a police raid which resulted in the club&#8217;s closure in 2005. The
club reopened in 2009, only to be closed down a year later, and then
reopened a third time in 2017. Like grime, which was developing concurrently
in London, bassline was associated with violence, anti-social behaviour and
criminal activity during the time of its rise to popularity, which
contributed to a general lack of willingness among venue owners and the
police to accommodate bassline events.</span></li>

production style that cross pollinates several other genres and styles, but
it firmly lives under the Electronic genre as a production style that is
almost exclusively used in DJ / Electronic Dance Music productions. The
production process involves taking sampled or edited material that has
existing drums in it and then adding other drum elements to it by layering
them on top of the existing drums. These elements would typically be Kick,
Snare, Hi-Hat, Crash, but could also include Toms and various percussion
instruments. The existing drums are greatly diminished by a variety of
techniques that include (but are not limited to) EQ &#038; Filtering, while
the layering process is aided by Side Chain Compression of the sampled /
edited material keyed by the new Kick Drum. The end result is a very thick
and full sounding production especially in the low end of the frequency
spectrum. You would typically see Beatdown listed (in tandem) on releases
with genres &#038; styles like (but not limited to) Disco, Funk, Soul,
Boogie, Nudisco, House, Downtempo and Techno, but the production style could

School is a style of electronic music that emerged in the 1970s.[1] An
offshoot of Krautrock, Berlin School was so named because most of its early
practitioners were based in West Berlin, Germany. It was shaped by artists
such as Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Manuel Gottsching. Innovative
Berlin School recordings were a precursor of ambient music.

The genre&#8217;s identification with space music distinguished it from the
more percussive and rhythm-oriented Düsseldorf School, which included Can,
Cluster, Kraftwerk, and Neu!. These latter bands have had a greater impact
on synthpop and techno, while the Berlin School was a wellspring for
ambient, electronica, new-age and trance.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>91,794 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Breakbeat is
a primarily UK-based style that existed alongside and quickly became infused
into hardcore rave/techno music, in turn leading to faster, more complex
[jungle](https://www.discogs.com/style/jungle) and
[hardcore](https://www.discogs.com/style/hardcore) music. Breakbeat is
characterized by a prominent, syncopated 4/4 rhythm constructed from
breakbeats—i.e., sampled drum breakdowns from
[rock](https://www.discogs.com/genre/rock),
[jazz](https://www.discogs.com/genre/jazz),
[funk](https://www.discogs.com/style/funk), and
[hip-hop](https://www.discogs.com/genre/hip+hop) music. Unlike jungle,
breakbeat has very little variation or rearrangement of the drum patterns,
and it is usually slower/mid-tempo, roughly 100 to 125 BPM, speeding up as
the style evolved into jungle. The &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; of breakbeat was
the early 1990s.

Some Discogs users apply the Breakbeat tag to any release that utilizes
breakbeat samples, but such usage is contentious, especially for releases
outside the 1988–1993 timeframe; the tag was originally intended to refer
specifically to the pre-jungle/pre-hardcore music that was actually called
breakbeat, or as a way to differentiate breakbeat-based techno from
non-breakbeat-based.

There is no tag specifically for &#8220;beats and breaks&#8221; types of
releases intended for DJs and music producers, nor is there a tag for other
forms of dance music that contain funky drum breaks (aside from Breaks),
regardless of whether it is made with samples, tape loops, drum machines, or
played live. Some Discogs users nevertheless use Breaks and Breakbeat tags
on these types of records, going back as far as 1982 for the first Jive
Rhythm Trax release.

Florida Breaks, Progressive Breaks, and Nu Skool Breaks.

The breaks sound was very popular at raves in California, Florida, New York
City, and the UK. It is not closely connected to the UK
breakbeat/proto-jungle scene of the early &#8217;90s, for which the
Breakbeat tag is applicable.

The Breaks tag often appears in conjunction with the Acid tag.

The Breaks tag is also often used for some slower dance music styles based
on very prominent breakbeat samples, often with a hip-hop/scratch-DJ
influence, but generally steering clear of the aforementioned scenes and
styles. This strain of breaks starts as early as 1987 with releases by
Criminal Element Orchestra and Bomb The Bass, includes classic early
&#8217;90s releases by Depth Charge and Fatboy Slim, and continues to the
present day.

(also commonly referred to as “chipmusic,” &#8220;chipstyle music,&#8221; or
“8-bit music,” despite often involving sounds characteristic of post-8-bit
systems) is a subset of electronic music created using the primitive / raw
sound synthesis characteristic of early generation home computer &#038;
video game hardware. This can be achieved through modern musicmaking tools,
through the original home computing / gaming consoles themselves (often
making use of homebrew software and/or hardware), or a combination of the
two.

Some platforms commonly adopted for this style of music include home
computers such as the Commodore 64, Atari ST series, and ZX Spectrum; and
gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Genesis,
the Nintendo Game Boy, and so forth.

What most of these devices have in common is that they predate the era of
home computers &#038; gaming platforms capable of sampled audio playback;
instead they relied on dedicated onboard soundchips for all audio, sound
effects, and music, providing (by today&#8217;s standards) fairly simple
realtime audio synthesis, with limited timbral range and polyphony generally
limited to as few as three voices.

Chiptune is generally considered distinct from VGM (video game music),
insofar as chiptune is often stylistically and conceptually removed from the
music typical of games. Of course this line can often be blurry, and the two
have considerable overlap.</span></li>

soul, and gospel. Vocals (both male and female) are common, and lyrical
themes include positivity, community, love, self-belief, and overcoming
hardship. Overly synthetic sounds are downplayed, in favor of pianos,
organs, horns, bass guitar, etc. Tracks sometimes follow more of a
conventional verse-chorus-verse structure than other forms of house.

In the 2010s, &#8220;deep house&#8221; has been applied to a newer style of
house that tends toward the dreamy, laid-back, subdued, atmospheric,
reflective, and minimalistic. (This sense of the term is roughly synonymous

Drones are also used in Doom Metal, where the bass line remains unchanged

It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related
styles such as 2-step garage, broken beat, drum and bass, jungle, dub and
reggae. According to urban legend, the term dubstep was coined in 2002 by

(also known as fantasy music) is an Ambient genre that emerged in the early
1990s, stylistically related to orchestral Soundtracks, particularly Film
Score music. Where the purpose of a film score is to set the mood
accompanying visual scenery, dungeon synth can be considered a similar
concept using sound only, making it a &#8216;score without a film&#8217;. In
this sense, the genre is a highly narrative form of music, with
&#8220;scenes&#8221; that are played out in almost theatrical fashion.
Synthesizers and keyboards are the primary instruments of choice, with
vocals, samples and acoustic instruments also frequently used. Pioneered by
artists such as Mortiis, Burzum and Pazuzu, the intention of dungeon synth
is generally to evoke settings of fantasy and adventure, drawing inspiration
from European mythology, fantasy writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, fairy
tales, as well as role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. Dark Ambient
music, Western Classical Music and Darkwave are often cited as influences
for the mood and atmosphere of dungeon synth. The style is also used in the
soundtracks of some Video Game Music with medieval or dungeon-based
settings, often being blended with Bit Music.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>288,028 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>A style
that began as an early form of hip-hop, Electro has grown to encompass
anything that uses the classic, electronic, syncopated beat found on tracks
like &#8220;Planet Rock&#8221; by Afrika Bambaataa or &#8220;White
Lines&#8221; by Grandmaster Flash &#038; The Furious Five, or as popularized
by Herbie Hancock&#8217;s &#8220;RockIt&#8221;. Electro is also applied
retroactively to some of the music of Kraftwerk, particularly
&#8220;Numbers&#8221; and &#8220;Home Computer&#8221;—forward-looking,
danceable electronic tracks which were highly regarded in early hip-hop
culture.

Aside from the distinctive rhythm pattern, Electro is often distinguished by
an emphasis on synthesizers, vocoders, and dry,
syncopated/&#8221;funky&#8221; drum sounds (as opposed to the monotonous,
low-pitch bass drum of house and techno). In contrast to typical hip-hop
approach of mining funky beats and warm basslines from old vinyl and
emphasizing a rap vocal, the Electro vibe is more about producing new, cold,
heavily synthetic-sounding beats and minimal basslines, with chanted vocals,
extended instrumental passages, and minor-key lead synth themes.

The funky side of Electro can include sung vocals, is also known as
Electro-Funk, and was a basis of the freestyle genre (initially &#8220;Latin
hip-hop&#8221;). The Techno side of Electro is rooted in the music of
Cybotron and Model 500, and was defined more fully in the &#8217;90s by
artists such as Drexciya and Anthony Rother. The term or prefix Electro is
also applied to synth-pop and industrial dance music with little or no
hip-hop connection, but which just incorporated similarly styled beat
patterns, instrumentation, and overall feel.

In recent years, club and mainstream dance music has been infiltrated by a
more modern and rock-influenced sound, now known as
&#8220;Electro-House&#8221; and sometimes just referred to as Electro. This
sound usually features a loud, four to the floor kickdrum with melodies and
basslines remeniscent of 80&#8217;s synth-pop. As with Electroclash and in
contrast with pure Electro, Electro-House is often dominated by lead synths
or samples which use distortion as a characteristic effect; examples include
some of the music of Justice or Kavinsky.

On Discogs, Electro is a style tag in both the Electronic and Hip Hop
genres. If in doubt which genre applies, ask in the Database Forum.

During one of the major updates of the Discogs back end, Electronic genre
releases with no style tag were given the tag Electro automatically. This

emerged in the late 1980s as a style of vocal House music from the European
continent. The style originated in songs with strong influences from
Dance-pop on a House music background.

It developed in parallel with Eurodance (which distinguishes itself by a
high BPM and influences from Techno and Hi-NRG) throughout the 1990s and
several Euro House bands, such as Cappella and 2 Brothers On The 4th Floor,
were also dedicated to Eurodance or Italodance.</span></li>

generally refers to disco-pop songs that have a strong influence from
Italo-disco yet do not originate from Italy. The term suggests a relation to
Europe as a whole, although most songs belonging to this genre are
overwhelmingly German productions Just like Italo-disco, it includes mixing
electronic sounds and disco rhythms together with a strong synth prominence
to create a bittersweet tune accompanied by vocals which are often
contemporary-themed.
This style heavily dominated the German music industry during the
mid-1980&#8217;s and gained popularity in several other European countries
such as France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although it fell
into obscurity in the 1990&#8217;s, its influence lived on through the
following genres such as Eurodance, Europop, Eurobeat etc.</span></li>

Eurobeat from the 1980&#8217;s were mainly produced by the Italians, as well
as many of the Stock, Aitken &#038; Waterman productions. It includes many
elements of Italo-disco and Hi NRG and comprised of a much slower pace when
compared to the newer Eurobeat still being produced by the Italians for the
Japanese market which has a very fast BPM, with some in between releases
still using the more traditional &#8220;slower&#8221; BPMs as used in the
1980&#8217;s Eurobeat. Much of the Eurobeat produced in the late 80&#8217;s
and early 90&#8217;s began to transform and branch off from the traditional
Eurobeat by incorporating many new influences such as Italo house music,
techno, and Eurodance.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>26,867 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Popular in
nightclubs during the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Very formulaic,
Eurodance makes heavy use of synthesizers: strong basslines, pounding beats,
with a set tempo anywhere between 90 and 160 beats per minute, but usually
in the 120-150 range. A typical song will have male rappers sing the verses
and female singers perform the chorus, but variations are not rare.

Eurodance was at its peak from 1993 to the early 2000s, with acts such as
Snap!, Technotronic, Corona, Masterboy, Cappella, DJ BoBo, Real McCoy and
Culture Beat being amongst the most popular names.

The style was born out of cross-influence between various styles, including
Hip Hop, House, Techno, Hi-NRG, Euro Disco and Italo Disco. A bulk of the
production of the era was made in Italy and Germany. Entering the 2000s, the
style changed drastically and branched out to be associated with new
subgenres, including Italodance and Hands Up, while sometimes still being
called Eurodance.

Eurodance is sometimes confused with the related Euro House, which in fact
draws influences from Dance-pop, rather than Techno and Hi-NRG.</span></li>

class='gsl-label'>Experimental music consciously deviates from established
musical norms (of a particular genre, or of music in general). Music of
almost any genre can be considered experimental – but the term is most
associated with the more abstract and challenging strains of electronic
music, jazz, and the modernist avant-garde of the mid-20th century.

Experimental music might explore new compositional techniques (e.g., John
Cage&#8217;s use of the I Ching, or Steve Reich&#8217;s process music), new
musical forms (e.g., drone music or free improvisation), unusual instruments
(e.g., the theremin, or Harry Partch&#8217;s homemade instruments),
extramusical sounds (e.g., musique concrète or Matmos), &#8220;extended
technique&#8221; (playing instruments in unusual ways – e.g., Cage&#8217;s
prepared piano), microtonal scales, minimalism (e.g., lowercase music),
unexpected stylistic fusions, abrasive timbres and rhythms, or any other
aspect of music.

As such, &#8220;experimental music&#8221; isn&#8217;t really a single style
with a distinct sound. It&#8217;s more of a sensibility: an effort to
explore new musical frontiers, and to expand the boundaries of musical
experience.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Funkot</span><span
class='gsl-title'>295 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Funkot /
Hardfunk is a fast &#038; pumpin dance music genre originated from Indonesia
and begin to grow audience there in the early 2000s. It’s key signatures are
funky drum pattern, pumpin bassline, atmospheric synths &#038; heavy use of
voice samples. Other common characteristic is the groove flow that feels
quite similar to locally-popular dangdut music, also originated from
Indonesia.

Funkot/Hardfunk was born initially as an experiment by some Indonesia’s
early generation DJs/Producers such as Jockie Saputra, Krazy Sandy &#038;
Tommy Fans. Jockie Saputra exhibited some early funkot form with his
creative live-mixing and loop sampling skills which in one example he
performed with live-remix of “Kolam Susu” in mid 1990’s. Later he will remix
many popular dub ,soulfull &#038; classic house music either live or
digitally to became sounded more “funky” or “urban”. Tommy Fans &#038; Krazy
Sandy mostly well known for several original tracks with unique beat model
(later become one of funkot’s basic beat model) such as “Lenong Groove”
&#038; “Soon Da”. Tommy Fans particularly was the most advanced thinking and
professional equiped music creator in Indonesia at that time. Many
yet-to-become future producers looked up to these early legends as their
inspirations and also tutors.

With the arrival of hard house and hard trance to Indonesia in the late
1990’s, fast &#038; powerful dance music became increasingly more popular
than conventional house music. In this particular period few creative
producers such as C2 frequently modified several parts of a popular club
song (chorus part for example) by replacing the usual 4/4 kick pattern with
funky drum pattern &#038; also sometimes modified the bassline to dangdut
style bass. These remix method proved to be very well received by most
Indonesian partygoers at the time due to its culturally familiar sound
result. This modification extended over time from partial to eventually
entire song utilizised various sampled materials from many classic hits such
as percussion loop, instrumentals and voice phrases makes it a new unique
bootleg genre. While some DJs still mention this kind of music as “House
Music” or “Funky House”, most Indonesians acknowledged this genre as “Funky
Kota” or simply “Funkot” due to its origin of popularity (and producers) at
“Kota” district in Jakarta, the city’s dance music &#038; nightlife central
area. However nowadays alternative names are also used such as “Hardfunk” or
“Funkcore” which eliminates “Kota” word thus give it more relation with the
actual content rather than geographic refference.

Because general club tracks in early 2000s have a universal tempo range
(around 140BPM – 160BPM) means almost every song existed technically could
be remixed to a club track. And because funkot in particular was not bound
with any existing genre’s characteristics meaning it was a more versatile
and interesting new option for a remix. Many amateur &#038; already existed
producers applied funkot remix to various pop hits at the time &#038; also
reworked classic dance hits which met by overwhelmingly positive response
from the crowd. The tempo itself continued to increase every year
(influenced mostly from the booming &#038; popularity of ecstassy which
makes the user always wanted to go faster and harder) until in recent state
reach 180BPM as its basic tempo and sometimes featured a 130BPM downtempo
section if the remix material couldn’t fit perfectly in 180BPM. Although
most early funkot production quality were deemed pretty bad by today
standards (both technical and creative aspects) that didn’t stop the trend
to keep continue gained mass popularity in Indonesia until around year 2010.

The genre itself keep changing forms and adapt many new music trends from
all over the world, with its leading pioneer Jockie Saputra became its first
main developer with his iconic pumping percussion sound and fat bassline
style. Other brainchilds of the genre include some of the most creative
minds in Indonesian funkot scene such as DJ Abaz, DJ Andi, DJ Ronny, DJ Roy
B, DJ Apin, DJ Nicko, DJ Dealy and many more (later including their
proteges) helped to develop the genre in their respectively distinct style
and signatures. In their hands the genre reached its peak popularity and
creative performance. Unfortunately until then this genre had not yet
recognized outside Indonesia mainly due to poor management and lack of
proper promotion skills of the producers. In most cases many independent
individuals self-published their own tracks or remixes, even the ones
officially published by record label were not distributed or promoted very
well. Resulting in degrading production quality and image.

Lately due to the extensive efforts of well designed promotion and
constructive interactions between some Indonesian Funkot pioneers and other
producers worldwide the genre already started to recognized by several small
community groups in related countries such as Japan, India, US, Myanmar etc,
and so far it generally received positive responses. Ironically while it
seems to start blossom in some countries it actually begin to lost
significant popularity in its own birthplace Indonesia. The main cause
beside introduction of new fresh genre is funkot considered dated right now
by most Indonesians after aired for more than 10 years whilst in other
countries it is still a fresh and exciting new stuff. Some producers from
other countries are even already active producing their own version of
Funkot.

The light may already started to dim at home but the story is just about to
begin in other places. For those creative minds everywhere the limit of what
this genre can do is endless. As for the ones who from the very beginning
dedicated their career for decades to developing and bring this genre till
this point, it sure will always has a special place in their hearts.</span>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Gabber</span><span
class='gsl-title'>24,416 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Style of
hardcore born in Rotterdam (the Netherlands) in the early 90s as a
counter-reaction towards the house scene of Amsterdam with its luxurious
clubs and snobby clubgoers. Sometimes the music and its culture are linked
to soccer hooliganism and the extreme right movement, and not completely
without a reason, for these subcultures do possess similar characteristic
elements. Also known and referred to as gabba, hardcore or gabberhouse.
&#8220;Gabber&#8221; (Dutch) translates to &#8220;mate&#8221; and a similar
word can be found on many Germanic languages.

The most prominent and distinctive feature of gabber is a repetitive 4×4
kick drum that is usually created by a drum machine (such as Roland TR-909)
or by sampling and which is then distorted/edited to bring a gabber song the
distinguishable melodic bass tone. With such a bass drum, an additional or a
separate bassline is seldom used. Drum fills occur oftentimes at the
middle/end of each pattern.

Almost as important to a gabber song is the wet-reverberated clap
accompanied with a snare drum and open hi-hat. These aforementioned sounds
can be played in between the kick drums, as well. Also vocal samples from
rap and contemporary pop music &#038; movies, musical loops from other
subgenres of electronical dance music such as techno and trance, guitar
riffs from rock/heavy music and drum loops &#038; breakbeats are used. As
drum n bass – breaking through from the UK – gained popularity worldwide,
especially in the Netherlands this was reflected as a heavy use of the
so-called &#8220;Amen break&#8221; in gabber productions around &#8217;95.
It is common in gabber music to play the (vocal) samples, synths and drum
loops on two different octaves. All these things contribute to the drive,
dynamics and the hefty, bouncing rhythm of this style.

Alongside the Netherlands, gabber was and is still mostly produced and
released in Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy and USA. The BPM-range
varies from 130 to 230. In the heyday of gabber music (1993–1998) the
leading trend was a tempo of 170–190 BPM. Towards the end of the 90s gabber
of the newstyle/new school started to emerge with sounds and aesthetics
leaning more towards the world of doomcore, hardcore techno and hard house
instead of the traditional inspiration and influence from hard trance,
(happy) hardcore and jungle/drum n bass. The Dutch sound turned into
something much darker, sinister and less melodic. German gabber, on the
other hand, had always been from the darker and less happy side. The mid-90s
German sound was also notably faster compared to the rest of the
Europe&#8217;s, bringing its ties closer to the birth of speedcore along
with certain American artists.

Summa summarum — gabber is the outcome from the fusion of the undergournd
rave culture in Europe: the Dutch techno, the faster Belgian beats, the
hardcore sound of Germany, and the whole unbridled acid house legacy from
the United States, infused all together with massive sampling from the world
of the contemporary pop culture and tongue-in-cheek usage of profanities à
la rap acappellas that give this genre its wonderfully whacky signature
imprint not far way from the realm of novelty music, in terms of certain
sincerity and off-the-wall innovativity.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Goa Trance</span><span
class='gsl-title'>13,753 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>The term Goa
Trance was first used in 1994 and changed in 1996 for Psy Trance. In the
beginning the terms Goa and Psychedelic became intermingled, with the full
term being Psychedelic Goa Trance, later as the sound progressed after
1998-1999 the term Goa was used only in reference of the old pre1999 sound
and releases. According to Goa legend DJ Chicago in an interview in mushroom
magazine &#8220;&#8230; it started being known as both Goa Trance and
Psychedelic Trance somewhere in the mid 90s. As i remember they were
interchangeable&#8221;. Psychedelic Trance along with its sub genres was
what inherited the continuity of the Goa term. The first specific labels
were Dragonfly Records that edited in August 93 the compilation Project II
Trance &#038; Underground French-Kommunication. Then a lot of
&#8220;Goa&#8221; labels were founded in London : TIP , Platipus, Matsuri,
Flying Rhino, Blue Room Released, Bomm Records, CelticRecords, Sirius
Records, Phantasm &#038; Symbiosis Records. This explosion of labels in
London was possible after Paul Oakenfold gave to the Goa sound legitimacy on
« The Essential Mix », a popular Radio show on BBC Radio 1. Meanwhile in
Germany, Goa artists were diffused via classical Trance labels like Gaia
Tonträger, Tunnel Records, Polytox Records, Spirit Zone Recordings and Eye Q
Records and the style became also very popular in Israel with groups like
Astral Projection or Infected Mushroom. Lots of Goa Trance fans consider the
12&#8243; &#8220;Etnica Tribute&#8221; as a milestone of the style. In 1998
the scene got another direction more dark &#038; repetitive like Techno. So
this style of &#8220;Goa Trance&#8221; is in fact the Psy Trance.

Goa Trance is played in tempo around 130-150 bpm . This kind of Trance is
hypnotic, with pulsing melodies, floating
basslines and use a lot of Mid-Asiatic musical phrasing. A popular element
of Goa trance is the use of samples, often from science fiction movies
&#038; all that refeer to esoterism. Most of the technology used was popular
analogue synthesizers. Another caracteristic from the style is that the Djs
used DAT players to execute theirs sets, because they&#8217;re more
practical to travel and less sensitive to the beach sand. While the DAT
didn&#8217;t have a pitch control system the mix between the songs was very
short and not necessary in the tempo. Another &#8220;Goa&#8221; tradition is
to make a blank between the sets so the dj&#8217;s can estimate their
popularity by the dancers applause level.</span></li>

hardcore is a genre of electronic music originally developed in the United
Kingdom and The Netherlands. It is present mainly in the UK, Europe, the
North American continent and Australia. In the UK, the genre emerges in the
early 1990s and is originally characterized by breakbeat sound samples and
variants of other musical styles such as hip hop and italohouse.
Subsequently in 1996 the genre divided into two distinct sub-genres, the
first focusing on the breakbeat and the second containing the codes of
hardcore techno, characterized by a line of semi-distorted kicks 4/4.

In 1995, the first happy hardcore singles such as I Wanna Be A Hippy and
Wonderful Days, and Dutch groups Technohead and Charly Lownoise &#038;
Mental Theo, respectively, enter the national music charts and give a first
timid media popularity to the genre. In 1997, happy hardcore reaches its
peak of popularity in mainly British and Dutch markets through the growth in
sales of music compilations like Bonkers UK, the Dutch Thunderdome and Happy
2b Hardcore in Canada, as well as the fact that many singles of the genre
appear in international music charts. However, in 1998, the genre begins to
decline sharply and much of the public believes it to be &#8216;dead&#8217;.
In the early 2000s however, it revives partially in the form of a new
related genus reworked named UK hardcore, mainly directed towards the
euphoric trance.</span></li>

early 2000s with club nights such as Tidy, Sundissential and Storm.
DJ&#8217;s/Producers such as former Trade resident Tony De Vit &#038; Ian M,
BK, Andy Farley, Andy Pickles &#038; Amadeus Mozart (Tidy Boys), Lisa
lashes, Rachel Auburn and Lisa Pin-Up. Subsequentially Hard House record
labels were formed such as Tidy Trax, Nukleuz, Jump Wax Records, and Tripoli
Trax.

*Confusingly the term Hard House is sometimes used in reference to the House
tracks that were being released in the US prior to the term being adopted in
the UK. Typically a &#8216;harder&#8217; sounding House style coming out of
New York city.</span></li>

the 1990s, fueled by the Schranz movement, a new, extremely hard style of
Techno became popular, which is now generally referred to as Hardtechno.
This style runs at very high bpm, usually 150 or more and features heavy
distortion and prominent kickdrum.

Not to get confused with Dark Techno. Many affluent mainstream Techno
listeners often regard the darker variant of it as being called Hard Techno.
It should not be confused with the new-coming Industrial/Early Techno sound
produced by artists like I Hate Models or AIROD which often goes around
135-140 BPM. The BPM often makes a great difference and Hard Techno
oscillates around 150 BPM or higher—as mentioned above. </span></li>

falls into two distinct periods, but both have their birthplace in Germany.
The original style (which became popular around 1993-94), was typified by a
fast (+150bpm) tempo along with strong acid lines and prominent melodies.
Popular acts around this time were Sunbeam, Komakino and Jeyênne.

This progressed up until the late 90&#8217;s, when a new style of Hard
Trance emerged thanks to the likes of DJ Scot Project &#038; Kai Tracid.
This new style brought the tempo down into the 140bpm range, and focused
more on Euphoric Trance in construction. The kick drums &#038; basslines
were exaggerated, bringing an aggressiveness which separated the style from
standard Trance. Also, producers such as DJ Scot Project pioneered extended
breakdown / buildups, hightening the tension.

It ceased being popular in the mid-2000&#8217;s.</span></li>

can refer to 1a) electronic dance music style &#8220;hardcore&#8221; that is
usually quite fast and always rather hard (hence the name), 4×4-beat form of
techno. Originated and popular in Germany, Belgium and Holland. Also
favoured and prominent since the early days in UK and US. Developed from the
sounds of acid, techno, house and hardcore breakbeat of which more later. In
Belgium the style of new beat should be mentioned as precedent to techno.
Later faster variation of techno was being produced in Belgium which
eventually led to hardcore and gabber over there.

Hardcore can be fairly minimal and refined consisting of synthetic pad
sounds, a (Roland TB-303) acid line, drum pattern (Roland TR-909 or TR-808,
for example) and sampled vocal sounds. The beat from the drum machine is
similar to any other harder variety of electronica: open and closed hi-hats,
snare, clap, ride cymbal and cymbal at the beginning of a pattern and on the
fills at the end. Usually used in a way that gives the style its distinctive
frenzy and hardness, and making the hectic beat sound even faster than it
actually is. All the drum sounds can be also heavily reverberated, echoed,
flangered or being filtered up and down on the breakdowns or throughout the
entire song. Distortion is extremely often used especially on the kick drum
making it a highly distinguishable feature of the style.

Hardcore has also another side besides the more sophisticated one with
tweaking acid lines and drum machine-made beats: and equally hard but more
brutal and not-so-subtle, based more on sampling of sounds and voices,
synths and hoovers and breakbeats/drum loops. With the clap and snare
beating each time – or on 2 &#038; 4 – on the 4×4 beat, this variation of
hardcore is closely related to gabber which is the most similar style within
the electronic genre. Compared to gabber, hardcore tends to be a bit slower
but the tracks are executed in a more complex way sound- and structurewise.
It&#8217;s more sinister, whereas gabber can be described often quite silly,
joyous and tongue-in-cheek and leaning on (melodic) rhythm patterns,
although humour is not completely unknown to hardcore either. The BPM-count
may be lower but the overall atmosphere of a song is darker and harder-edge.
Hard techno and industrial hardcore are two other styles akin.

The kick drum can be hard, sharp and technolike or harsh, distorted and raw.
It can be echoed or reverbed to give it a full, pumping character that moves
the track forward. The distortion can also be used in the same manner as in
jumpstyle, gabber, hard trance or US hard house: making the bass drum low
and booming but not turning the waveform jaded or jagged; maintaining
certain roundness and softness to it. The tempo is within 130–235 BPM.
German Marc Trauner (Acardipane) released the first song considered hardcore
in 1990: Mescalinum United – We Have Arrived.

1b) Hardcore breakbeat – a style of electronic dance music with a broken,
mostly sampled beat structure. Emerged in the UK in the early 90s. Lots of
pitched-up rap vocal samples and drumloops, hoovers, stabs, pianos and
chords used. Heavy on bass; sub-bass sounds used. Predecessor of jungle and
drum &#038; bass. BPM: 120–150.

or

2) Rock style – also known as hardcore punk – that was started in the late
70s by Middle Class, followed by Black Flag and then by the likes of
Discharge (from Stoke-on-Trent), Circle Jerks, Minor Threat, Asocial, Dead
Kennedys, Misfits, Bad Brains, The Germs and many, many more. While early
hardcore punk was extremely tied to punk rock, the genre developed into a
more aggressive and of shorter songs. The term &#8220;hardcore punk&#8221;
was probably coined by Discharge (from Middlesborough, not the D-beat band
from Stoke-on-Trent) in their 1980 split EP with The Filth, in their song
&#8220;Hardcore Punx&#8221;. Canadian Band D.O.A.&#8217;s Seminal 1981
12&#8243; &#8220;HARDCORE &#8217;81&#8221; also forwarded the term to
general use. The expression &#8220;mosh&#8221; (as in &#8220;moshing&#8221;
or &#8220;mosh pit&#8221;) is attributed to H.R. – reggae/hardcore punk band
Bad Brains vocalist and frontman – who used the word &#8220;mash&#8221;
(pronounced &#8220;mosh&#8221; in a Jamaican accent) lyrically and on-stage,
in the means of inciting and to describing the aggressive and often violent
dancing that took place in concerts.</span></li>

implies, Hi-NRG is a higher-BPM style of dance music that was very popular
in the 1980s, especially in gay nightclubs. It evolved from disco,
preserving the four-on-the-floor kick drum and emphasizing strong melodies
and simple octave bass lines, but also having a harder, more rock-like
sound, with pop vocals and snare hits on the 2s and 4s. In addition to the
main beat, there was usually an accompanying second, a syncopated
&#8220;shuffle&#8221; rhythm, often made with a tambourine or similar
high-pitched snare sound (or, more often, an electronic variant thereof).

The early Hi-NRG repertoire was dominated by the dense, synth bass-driven
sound of American producers Patrick Cowley and Bobby Orlando, and then the
tighter, rapid-fire syncopated percussion of UK producers Ian Anthony
Stephens and Ian Levine. The later Hi-NRG sound was defined largely by the
PWL Hit Factory—producer/songwriters Stock/Aitken/Waterman and engineers
Phil Harding &#038; Ian Curnow—starting with Dead or Alive&#8217;s
&#8220;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&#8221; in 1984 and continuing
through a string of dance-pop hits in the late &#8217;80s.

In the first half of the &#8217;80s, Hi-NRG enjoyed mainstream success as
aerobics/workout music. The style&#8217;s peak in 1986–1988 led to wider
acceptance, with songs like &#8220;Boom Boom (Let&#8217;s Go Back to My
Room)&#8221; by Paul Lekakis and &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up&#8221; by
Rick Astley enjoying long chart runs and much radio play. This coincided
with an increasing influence of house music, like the use of longer, more
repetitive bass lines and open hi-hat sounds on the off beat. The peak was
followed by a very rapid decline as house music and Eurodance overtook the
club scene in 1989.</span></li>

music, also called hip-hop, rap music, or hip-hop music, is a music genre
consisting of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a
rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop
culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping,
DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements
include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. While often used to refer
to rapping, &#8220;hip hop&#8221; more properly denotes the practice of the
entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously
with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip
hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture,

The actual hip-house scene was almost exclusively a Chicago phenomenon which

created by house music producers, and featured a fast, syncopated rapping
flow. This was in contrast to what pioneering hip-house producer Fast Eddie
called &#8220;house rap&#8221;, in which hip-hop artists from other regions
combined more traditional, slower rapping styles with house, or the European

music is a genre of experimental music that emerged in the mid-1970s. Its
basic components are semi-acoustic and include the use of electronic
instruments as well as unusual objects such as metal rods and pipes, and
rigged power tools. It incorporates noise, tape manipulation, drones,
metallic timbres, monotonous rhythms evocative of machinery, and similar
&#8220;factory floor&#8221; aesthetics. Traditional instruments are
sometimes used, but usually in non-traditional ways. Vocals, if present,
tend to be either disaffected or angry. Lyrical content tends to embody dark
themes, as well as protest, tension, uncertainty, and the like. As with many
alternative styles, it generally eschews pop melodies, virtuosic solos, and
romantic themes.

Industrial has always had a fragmented identity, not having anywhere near as
cohesive a sound as most other electronic genres, and it has long had a
love/hate relationship with dance music. In its early years (mid-1970s to
mid 1980s), industrial music was partly rhythmic but rarely
danceclub-friendly, and was predominantly a product of the heady British,
Australian, and European art-school scenes.

After the split of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, Industrial music spawned
several subgenres that have been described as Post-industrial music. This
includes genres such as Power Electronics (Whitehouse), Ambient Industrial
or Dark Ambient (Lustmørd), Martial Industrial (Laibach), Ritual music (Zero
Kama), and Electronic body music, a genre that combines Industrial elements
with early Electro-punk (DAF). Many of these styles have their own entry on
Discogs.

In the mid and especially latter half of the 1980s, bands from the New
Wave/SynthPop scene such as Ministry adopted elements of Post-industrial
music (e.g. EBM) and Rock music and laid the foundations of Industrial rock.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Italo House</span><span
class='gsl-title'>4,462 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'> Italo House
is a form of &#8216;House music’ that originated in Italy. It was mainly
popular in Italy, the U.K., and the United States in the late 80&#8217;s to
early 90’s and has since become more popular all over the world. This style
of music originally blended House music with the Italo Disco sound, hence
the name ‘Italo House’. The main characteristic of this musical genre
originally was the use of samples, especially female vocal samples over a
House groove that was predominantly ruled on some tracks by electronic piano
chords. Taking influences from the early Chicago House hits of the late 80s.

Typically the vocals used in most Italo House tracks where sampled from
early U.S. Freestyle and House tracks, such as ‘Listen Up – Listen Up’,
‘Darcy Alonso &#8211; Waited so long’, ‘Kristol &#8211; Passion of a woman’
&#038; ‘India &#8211; Dancing on the fire’ etc. The music also featured male
&#038; female raps, or sections of raps which were lifted from Hip Hop or
Hip House acapella’s from around the same time. They also sampled the big
vocals from Disco Diva&#8217;s such as Aretha Franklin, Jocelyn Brown,
Loleatta Holloway, Patti La Belle and Seidah Garrett.

Samples came from various acapellas from tracks such as:- Aretha Franklin
&#8211; Rokk-A-Lott / Jocelyn Brown &#8211; I’m Gonna Get You Boy / Loleatta
Holloway &#8211; Love Sensation. These powerful vocals would usually be used
for the chorus, sometimes even not making much sense, due to the Italian
musicians and producers at the time not understanding English very well. A
prime example is the use of Loleatta Holloways ‘Right on time’ vocal, used
in the 1989 No.1 hit by Black Box called ‘Ride On Time’.

In most cases the Italo House sound makes use of a melodic repeated piano
chord progression, diva vocals, a 4/4 beat with a tempo of around
120-122bpm. During this time, Italo House musicians, producers also featured
acid sounds within their music and ventured as far as producing Techno, some
producers also incorporated the exciting piano sound that had now become the
basis of Italo House within some of their Techno releases.

The best known example of Italo House, as already mentioned is ‘Ride on
Time’ by ‘Black Box’. Black Box, along with the ‘FPI Project’, Media Records
‘Cappella’ and the ‘49ers’ made the genre very popular in the late
80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s with their very uplifting songs.

The original name ‘Italo House’ slowly drifted away around 1991 / 1992 and
it later became known as Italian-House, especially in the UK, but the sound
stayed the same ‘happy and euphoric’ pioneered essentially by the production
stable of Discomagics Severo Lombardoni and Media Records Gianfranco
Bortolotti. The latter carrying on the Italo House sound well into the
mid-90s, whose alter egos included Cappella, RAF, East Side Beat and the
49ers to name but a few. The music produced in Italy dominated the British
dance charts and clubs of the very early 90s (1990/1991) with songs like:-
Asha – JJ Tribute / DJ H feat Stefy – Think About / Pierre Feroldi – Movin
Now / Last Rhythm – Last Rhythm and Jinny – Keep warm, all expressing a
happy vibe &#038; atmosphere.

Probably the most well known Label and Distributor of the Italo House genre
would have to be Discomagic Records in Rome, which had many subsidiary
labels that featured Italo House music. This was by far the largest italo
Disco / House / Dance record label in Italy at the time and was run by
Severo Lombardoni. This label along with Media Records set the standards for
an entire genre of music.
In 1991, artists such as K-Klass, Bassheads, Love Decade etc. all created
excellent House music that incorporated piano chords that was typical of the
time when Italo House ruled the Northern UK House music scene. DJs such as
Sasha championed the Italo House sound and featured the genre heavily within
his sets. Clubs like Shelley’s, the Hacienda and Legends where also well
known for playing Italo House in 1990 and 1991 with Legends being well known
for playing more of the obscure Italo House.

To this day Italo House music is collected far and wide by keen, avid record
collectors, all chasing that illusive Italo House / Italian-House
track/tracks with some costing the buyer £100 +. These fanatics of Italo
House have become known as ‘Italo House Aficionados’.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Italodance</span><span
class='gsl-title'>30,800 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Italodance
is essentially Eurodance (or Euro House) music produced in Italy. More
specifically, it is a subgenre of House music that was popular in nightclubs
during the 1990&#8217;s in most of Europe, but particularly in Italy. Very
formulaic, this style makes heavy use of synthesizers: strong basslines,
pounding beats, with a set tempo anywhere between 120 and 160 beats per
minute. A typical song will have male rappers sing the verses and female
singers perform the chorus, but variations of that formula are frequent.
Songs featuring heavy sampling are not rare. Instrumental releases were also
fairly frequent.

While Eurodance was born out of cross-influence between various genres,
including Hip-Hop, House, Disco and Hi-NRG, Italodance takes heavier
inspiration from the 1980&#8217;s Italo Disco, with several producers from
the Italo Disco era crossing over, giving Italodance a distinct sound from
Eurodance.

Italodance production covers the entire span of the 1990&#8217;s, but
reached its peak in 1993 up to 1996. During this era, production was
absolutely massive; many records were being quickly produced, which leaded
to inconsistent output quality between releases. Nevertheless, the
Italodance wave created a fair amount of internationally successful acts,
such as Whigfield, Ice MC, Corona, Da Blitz, U.S.U.R.A., Double You, Alexia,
Gala and others. The genre is sometimes expanded to include late
90&#8217;s/early 2000&#8217;s acts such as Eiffel 65, the latter work of
Gigi d&#8217;Agostino and Paps &#038; Skar, which were also very successful
overseas.</span></li>

hardcore techno style that emerged during the mid 90&#8217;s and was
popularized by labels such as Sharpnelsound and ALiCE&#8217;S EMOTiON.
Specifically, J-Core is a variation of Happy Hardcore and Gabber. It&#8217;s
known for fast-paced heavy sampling, often high-pitched vocals and
incorporates many &#8220;otaku&#8221; themes, such as anime, videogames or
typical japanese pop culture. More broadly, the term is also used as an
umbrella term for a wide range of hard electronic music featuring these
themes, ranging from jungle/breakbeat to speedcore. For a long time there
was no term coined for this kind of music, but when this style gained
international fame the term was coined around 2005 and from then on this
style of music was referred to as J-Core.

During the mid 90&#8217;s, Japan had a rich underground hardcore scene, but
at one point the Japanese scene began to divide with one movement sticking
to the original european style of hardcore (such as Bass2 Records and
Teikoku Records), and another moving towards a &#8220;geek culture&#8221;
kind of hardcore (such as Sharpnelsound, Toy Label and Murder Yacht School).
This second movement was very much about self-made doujin (fandom) releases,
not bothered by copyright since it was a very underground niche culture at
the time. As a result, many albums feature unlicensed remixes and in recent
years some labels have had to shut down the production of these albums or
face consequences.

During the 2000&#8217;s record labels such as ALiCE&#8217;S EMOTiON, C.H.S
and X-Treme Hard started to emerge which brought a more polished sound to
the scene and started to become more mainstream as the years progressed. At
this time the scene also gained international fame. Various stores sold the
albums internationally and events across the border started to happen too
(such as Hardcore Synergy at Anime Central).

Nowadays, many of the artists that made a name for themselves in the
90&#8217;s and early 2000&#8217;s are commissioned for official remixes of
anime or videogames or have original songs released on videogames like
Beatmania IIDX, but the unofficial scene is still going strong and releases
hundreds of new fan-made albums a year at events such as Comiket or M3
(Mixed Media Market) alongside the professionally licensed albums. Despite
the amount of releases though, it is still a very fleeting and underground
scene. </span></li>

Jazzdance is a vague synonym for Acid Jazz and other music in a similar
style.

When first added to Discogs, it was envisioned as another name for late
1990s Acid Jazz, or the slower side of Future Jazz. However, the term is
also said to have been used in the 1980s among Northern Soul nightclub DJs,
in reference to some of the 1950s–1980s funk, soul, and jazz music they
curated for the dancefloor. Relatively obscure selections from that scene
became known as Rare Groove by 1985, and the terms Acid Jazz and Dancefloor
Jazz were coined soon after to market contemporary acts playing in a
Jazzdance/Rare Groove style.

Some background:

In early 2001, former Discogs user SayVegin [proposed Future
Jazz](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/1205) as an Electronic style tag
for bands like Jazzanova, Fila Brazillia, and A Forest Mighty Black. He then
[proposed Jazzdance](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/1231#11569)
&#8220;for acts like Mr. Gone, Down To The Bone, Soulstance which have a
more dance-oriented tempo&#8221;.

With these examples, there is little to differentiate jazzdance from acid
jazz. At that time, the uptempo bossa and samba-infused nu-jazz/future-jazz
music of Jazzanova was very similar to that of Mr. Gone and Soulstance.
Meanwhile, Fila Brazillia&#8217;s midtempo, funky, sometimes-housey acid
jazz sound was not much different from the music of Down To The Bone.

In mid-2017, Discogs user cheebacheebakid, a former DJ in the genre,
[provided the broader
definition](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/748381#7424627), saying
Jazzdance encompassed all styles of jazz that were dancefloor friendly in
the 1980s and beyond: &#8220;Jazzdance (without the space) was one way
Gilles, Forge, et. al. referred to Rare Groove in the early 80s as played at
Dingwall&#8217;s, Ronnie Scott&#8217;s, The Jazz Cafe, etc. Like Northern
Soul (from which it kind of branched off), they were catch-all terms for
highly danceable jazz (usually Latin or Brazilian inflected). Often
Dancefloor Jazz was used as well, moreso by labels like Mojo, LuvNHaight,
etc.. It morphed into Acid Jazz as a marketing term when Acid House got huge
in late 80s. Then soon after Acid Jazz meant modern acts playing
Jazzdance/Rare Groove style music (e.g., Snowboy, BNH, JTQ, etc) and now it
iseems Jazzdance is used on anything remotely toe-tappable with a horn or
Hammond.&#8221;

characterized by high tempos (160 to 175 BPM being the average), chopped-up
and often seemingly random breakbeat sequencing, heavy basslines, Reggae
influence, and the iconic sound of Akai cyclic timestretch. Jungle also
focuses on a sense of atmospheric intelligence contrasting with the violent
sound of high tempo drums and basslines, juxtaposing the sounds of Romplers
and samples of New-Age songs with the heavy, relentless chopping of breaks
such as the famous Amen break. It is said to have given birth to such genres
as Drum And Bass and Breakcore.</span></li>

is not to be confused with Nerdcore Hip Hop. It is coincidental that these
were named similarly.

Nerdcore Techno is a style of Techno that emerged in Japan in the early
90&#8217;s and was popularized by labels such as
[全日本レコード](https://www.discogs.com/label/936329) and [Toy
Label](https://www.discogs.com/label/69643) as well as Jungle/Techno
collective [サイケアウツ](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1116830). It is most
often seen as a combination of Techno, Breakbeat and Jungle, known for
remixing melodies/heavy sampling of typical Japanese (and occassionally
western) pop culture and incorporating a comedic and/or nostalgic undertone.
Often referencing either campy 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s pop culture or
otaku/nerd culture such as anime or videogames, there is some overlap with
[J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core) artists/labels, and
Nerdcore Techno can be seen as the foundation of
[J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core). But while
[J-Core](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/j-core) focuses on the
Hardcore side of things, Nerdcore Techno focuses on the Techno and Jungle
side of music. The BPM can vary a lot depending on the artist&#8217;s
personal style but it often ranges between 130 and 160 BPM, leaning towards
the higher BPMs and can sometimes go as high as 180 BPM.

Nerdcore Techno&#8217;s origins seem to draw inspiration from early techno
acts like [Yellow Magic
Orchestra](https://www.discogs.com/artist/22061-Yellow-Magic-Orchestra) and
[Kraftwerk](https://www.discogs.com/artist/4654-Kraftwerk). One of the
earliest known examples of what could be reasonably be considered nerdcore
is a track called サイバー長介 by 猛毒 (https://youtu.be/q7440o6YTkk), released in
1992.

Many underground events focused on Nerdcore Techno were held and articles
appeared on Nerdcore Techno during the 90&#8217;s in Quick Japan, a prolific
music magazine. At the peak of its popularity it had a significant following
in Japan, though it remains largely an unseen, fleeting and mysterious
movement outside of Japan. Today, Nerdcore Techno continues to live on
mostly on the internet in the form of netlabels such as [Anything
Records](https://www.discogs.com/label/178394), but there are still examples
of labels that organize parties and release (pressed) physical releases. Toy
Label (among others) still regularly releases physical albums, and overseas
it has gained some traction as well in the form of labels such as
[NiTEFLARE](https://www.discogs.com/label/188528) and
[Allkore](https://www.discogs.com/label/150242). </span></li>

experimental as well. On the experimental side, it includes a broad range of
ambient music, space music, field recordings of nature sounds (rainfall,
lightning, trees rustling, animals, etc.), and may feature chanting or drone
noises. However, it almost always emphasizes tonal sounds and a lead melody.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>New Beat</span><span
class='gsl-title'>7,474 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>New Beat was
a wave of electronic dance music specific to the Belgian club scene from
around 1987 and into 1990, with its greatest popularity in 1988 and 1989.
New Beat was often characterized by a relatively slow beat incorporating
samples, synths and hypnotic bass lines. There&#8217;s not a lot of
&#8220;pure&#8221; New Beat music; it was always a fusion genre, constantly
incorporating the sounds of other popular dance music of its era, including
synth-pop, EBM/industrial dance, electro, house, acid house, and to a lesser
extent, Detroit techno.

New Beat had a significant, reciprocal influence on the stabby, buzzy
&#8220;rave&#8221; aesthetic in techno music. Influences from New Beat
evolved into the foundation of trance music (e.g. Age of Love&#8217;s
&#8220;The Age of Love&#8221; and Revelation&#8217;s &#8220;First
Power&#8221;/&#8221;Synth-It&#8221;).

New Beat faded into history as its artists increasingly converted to making
higher-tempo music more strongly associated with techno or trance.

In between of New Beat and Belgium Techno around 1989 there was Hard Beat,
also named Skizzo but mostly used is the term Hard Beat for that transition
sound of 1988 New Beat to 1990 Belgium Techno sound. (e.g. Boy Toy &#8211;
Touch My Body and Nasty Thoughts &#8211; Rock The House)</span></li>

emerged in the early 2000s as a contemporary, mostly electronic
interpretation of disco music.

Most nu-disco has no named sub-style or clearly defining characteristics,
other than being rhythmically disco-based and not fitting into any other
genre.

Nu-Disco often makes use of the standard disco rhythm (kick drum on every
beat and a closed hi-hat on every eighth note), rather than the
&#8220;high-energy&#8221; disco rhythm which underpins much house music
(same kick but with an open hi-hat on the &#8220;off beat&#8221;, i.e. every
eighth note in between). It may also incorporate 1980s Italo Disco-style
synths &#038; drum machines.

Some nu-disco is simply re-edits (sometimes with added effects) of
original-era disco &#038; boogie tracks. Some nu-disco is in a slowed-down
&#8220;slow motion&#8221;/&#8221;cosmic&#8221; style. Some is quite fast and
&#8220;hard&#8221; and can be more precisely described as
&#8220;electro-disco&#8221; or &#8220;electro-house&#8221; depending on its
resemblance to electro, electroclash, disco, and house. Some nu-disco has a
very retro, Italo-Disco inspired sound but probably should not be tagged as
Italo-Disco.

House&#8217;s roots are primarily in the U.K. in the beginning of the
&#8217;90s, typified by producers like William Orbit, with his Guerilla
label, and Leftfield, with their Hard Hands label. Two British DJs, Sasha
&#038; John Digweed helped popularize the sound in the club
&#8220;Renaissance&#8221;. The label Limbo Records launched from legendary
Glasgow record store 23rd Precinct was also a major actor of the style. One
of the biggest hits of the genre was &#8220;Passion&#8221; by Gat Decor.

Typical elements of the style are house rhythms around 125 BPM; a dubby,
galloping/chugging bassline; and a dreamy, spacey atmosphere. In a sense, it
is a combination of house and trance, with the soulful, booty-shaking
elements toned down and replaced by long chords and dubby ear candy. It
evolved into a more minimalistic aesthetic with the emergence of a new scene
in 2003 led by musician/DJs such as James Holden &#038; Nathan Fake from the
label Border Community.

Related styles are Progressive Breaks, Progressive Trance, and Progressive
Psytrance. It&#8217;s often difficult to say a particular track is strictly
progressive house, progressive breaks, or progressive trance, so people
often lump the three genres together under a single

year 1998 with German productions from X-Dream or Planet BEN. The
Scandinavian artists also brought a major influence to the style with a
colder and harder sound. Artists like Atmos, Koxbox or Son Kite made it
popular till 2002.

With technology the style has developed immensely, starting to sound like
the modern psy-trance at around 2003-2004.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Rhythmic Noise</span><span
class='gsl-title'>11,903 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Rhythmic
Noise is a form of Industrial music and a fusion of Noise with various
styles of Electronic dance music. Rhythmic Noise, aka power noise, should
not be confused with Power Electronics, which is not influenced by
Electronic dance music and is closer to harsh Noise. Its origins are
predominantly European.

Rhythmic Noise takes inspiration from a number of Industrial artists. Some
of the most influential include Esplendor Geométrico from Spain, active
since 1980, and Le Syndicat from France, active since 1982. The Belgian
artist Dive also anticipated the style in the early 90s and went on to also
form a purely Rhythmic Noise parallel project, Sonar, in the mid-90s. Some
releases on the harder and harsher end of the Techno spectrum have also been
influential such as the early EPs by Aphex Twin. EBM music (also known as
Industrial dance music) and electro-Industrial music styles have also been
big influences on the style&#8217;s development.

The synonymous term &#8220;power noise&#8221; was coined by Raoul Roucka of
Noisex in 1997, with the track &#8220;United (Power Noise Movement)&#8221;.

The genre gained larger exposure to the U.S. industrial scene by the
electro-Industrial act Wumpscut, who signed Noisex to the label Mental Ulcer
Forges.

Some other notable Rhythmic Noise artists operating around that time
included Imminent Starvation, P·A·L, Sonar, Winterkälte, and various
projects from members of Ars Moriendi.

Some notable Rhythmic Noise artists that emerged during the turn of the
century include Converter, Antigen Shift, Iszoloscope, Mono No Aware and
Terrorfakt.

The two most prominent labels known for Rhythmic Noise are Ant-Zen and Hand
Productions. Both labels starting focusing more on releasing Rhythmic Noise
during the late 90s.

There have often been very similar sounds coming from the harder, harsher or
more experimental areas of the Techno spectrum which, at times, has been
embraced by those into Rhythmic Noise. Examples of this such would be late
90s/Y2K era Speedy J, or releases on labels like Uncivilized World or Zhark
Recordings. However, since these scenes were somewhat insulated from each
other, they often didn&#8217;t use the same style descriptions.
DJ and Techno producer Adam X started trying to bridge the gap between these
scenes around the year 2000.
Some artists producing harder, harsher, or more experimental sounds in other
styles, such as Drum n Bass artist Panacea, have crossed over and have also
been an influence in the style&#8217;s development.

Characteristics:
Typically, Rhythmic Noise is instrumental, based upon distorted sounds with
distorted drums and other distorted percussive sounds often being the
primary focus. Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is usually
secondary to the rhythm. Rhythmic Noise tracks are typically structured and
danceable, but are occasionally more abstract and experimental. The genre is
showcased at the annual Maschinenfest festival in Oberhausen, Germany, as
well a number of other festivals.

Some groups, such as Combichrist and Dulce Liquido, merge Rhythmic Noise
along with aggrotech (an EBM/electro-Industrial style) or even merge
Rhythmic Noise with more commercial dance styles. Others, such as Tarmvred,
meld the style with Breakcore. Others still, merge elements of IDM, such as
Endif.

The 2010s has seen a resurgence of the harder, harsher and more experimental
sounds in Techno which crosses over a lot with the sounds of Rhythmic Noise,
although this is usually just known as industrial Techno, instead of
Rhythmic Noise (or power noise or noize) because people in these two scenes
were often unaware of each other&#8217;s music.
However, the Techno artist Ancient Methods (one of the artists responsible
for the resurgence of industrial Techno), sampled Rhythmic Noise artist
P·A·L&#8217;s track Gelöbnis on their second release from 2008, and Ancient
Methods later released some music on Hands Productions which is one of the
first labels that started heavily pushing the Rhythmic Noise sound back in
the 90s.
An example of an artist that was once known more primarily in the Rhythmic
Noise scene and is now well-known within the Techno scene would be Orphx.
Ancient Methods and Orphx have also collaborated together under the name
Eschaton with releases on the Techno label, Token.
Newer artists such as Ontal and Tomohiko Sagae have been releasing music on
both Techno labels and Rhythmic Noise labels.

There has also been and continues to be crossovers within other sounds and
scenes such as the Breakcore and IDM scenes.</span></li>

a form of hardcore that is characterized by a high tempo and aggressive
themes. The genre was created in the early to mid 1990s and the name
originates from the genre hardcore as well as the high speed tempo used.
This music rarely drops below 300 beats per minute (bpm). Earlier speedcore
tracks often averaged at about 250 bpm, which could be defined as
terror(core), whereas some tracks sometimes exceed 1000 bpm where it then
becomes known as extratone, the world&#8217;s fastest music genre.</span>

class='gsl-title'>435,764 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Synth-pop,
as a Discogs style tag, can apply to pretty much any [pop
music](https://www.discogs.com/genre/pop) dominated by synthetic sounds.
Before non-electronic music was allowed in the database, the tag was applied
quite liberally in order to justify the inclusion of dance records from the
pop and [R&#038;B](https://www.discogs.com/style/contemporary+r%26b) club
scenes, and is still used fairly broadly.

The synth-pop genre, though, primarily originates in late 1970s/early 1980s
[New Wave](https://www.discogs.com/style/new+wave), the post-punk
&#8220;alternative&#8221; rock movement that encompasses a wide range of
styles and attitudes. There are some non-New Wave synth-pop bands like Pet
Shop Boys, but on the whole, the synth-pop scene of the 1980s was dominated
by a faction of New Wave bands that embraced the use of electronic
instruments and relatively light, dance-oriented songwriting, yet still
retained a fairly typical four-piece rock-band structure (percussion, lead
instrument, bass instrument, vocal). Most synth-pop combines electronic and
other instruments, plus strong vocals and melodies, and elements of whatever
dance music styles are popular at the time. The music generally isn&#8217;t
very experimental, serious, or dark, but some synth-pop bands like [The
Human League](https://www.discogs.com/artist/10383-The-Human-League) and
members of the &#8220;minimal wave&#8221; scene explored a more alternative,
moody sound at times. Synth-pop enjoys revivals now and then, with new bands
deliberately paying homage to the old sounds, or just stumbling onto a
similar aesthetic in their experimentation with styles.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>19,968 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Synthwave is
a term that has been applied to a subgenre of New Wave music that began in
the late-1970s with the rise of affordable electronic instruments such as
synthesizers and sequencers. It became popular in the 1980s with artists
such as Depeche Mode, Anne Clark, KaS Product, Gary Numan, John Foxx, Fad
Gadget and others. The term is related to/overlaps with subbranches such as
Minimal wave, Cold wave, and Dark wave.

In the mid-2010s, the term also became associated with an &#8217;80s revival
style that draws on Italo-disco music and electronic soundtracks of many
1980s films, video games, cartoons and television shows. It incorporates or
closely imitates the sound of vintage analogue synthesizers, drum machines,
and effects and has been described as &#8220;retrofuturistic&#8221;. Despite
being named as if it were a branch of synthesizer-based New Wave music,
there is no direct relationship between the latter revivalist genre and
aforementioned New Wave style, nor with New Wave generally.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Tech House</span><span
class='gsl-title'>171,248 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>This genre
is a bit difficult to define, since there are different schools of thought
regarding its production and sound. Some of the earlier tracks of the genre
tried to integrate a 1/2 tempo dub sample, whereas some Chicago DJs early on
in the scene wanted to create a &#8220;harder&#8221; sound (e.g. releases
from Relief Records). Techno and House music have a shared history and
compatible sounds, so Tech House releases often combine elements from both
styles, usually inconsistently; some releases borrow more heavily from
techno, others from house. This lends itself to a gray area in defining a
recognizable sound that has persisted since its conception, through the
90&#8217;s and 00&#8217;s, and into today.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Tech Trance</span><span
class='gsl-title'>9,158 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>A subgenre of
trance that developed in the mid-1990s that is heavily influenced by techno.
It is characterized by the emphasis of synthesizers, rhythms, percussions
and basslines rather than melodies.
Tech Trance is sounds like the name also suggests how it would sound like;
Typically nowadays has a Trance song structure following with Techno sounds.
The purest form of Tech Trance has a Techno song structure and trancy
sounds. This type of Techno used to be called Trance back in the early
00&#8217;s and and in the 90s, but as time had also passed by, Tech Trance
took a complete 180 and instead went into a full blown scene. It
wasn&#8217;t experimental no more. It was a sensation, Energy, Trance
energy. Very notable artists of the genre would defintly be Sander van Doorn
aka Sam Sharp, Mark Sherry, Marco V, and Marcel Woods. In the late
00&#8217;s Tech Trance started to evolve into Electro Trance by the very
Marcel Woods himself. Sander van Doorn was very keen to the emerging Electro
trend aswell and also went along with him. In the very late 00&#8217;s Tech
Trance has gone underground again, even if there was any sign of it, it
still wasn&#8217;t truly Tech Trance no more. In the early 2010&#8217;s Tech
Trance or may I even say Electro Trance took another course. It started to
sound very bland, overcompressed and kind of cheap. Trance fans noticed the
change and quickly were calling the genre Trouse (Trance and House. Well,
the internet was wrong once again since the emrging sound had nothing to do
with Trance nor House. We could say that what came, was just like another
wave of rave. It actually sounded very much alike to the old skool Rave
aswell, however the genre got a name &#8211; Big Room House. Nowadays
it&#8217;s EDM, because this seems to be the most politically correct
gentrification, right? Well, thats the breif history of Tech Trance.

How it really sounds like? Take the advise from me and never trust Armin van
Buuren&#8217;s words about Trance nor Armada&#8217;s. Armin ruined Trance
once, Armada once again. No, Tech Trance does not sound like a melacholic
squarewave symphony what Armada seems to pull onto people, but rather
fast-paced, percussive, systematic and complex from sound design. What
separates Techno from Tech Trance is that Tech Trance creates a sensation,
while Techno doesn&#8217;t. What separates Trance from Tech Trance is the
atmosphere and thus it&#8217;s not classified as a subgenre of Techno, but
rather Trance.

How does Techno sound like? Cold, systematic, futuristic, percussive,
hypnotic.

How does Trance sound like? Hypnotic, spiritual, somewhat melodic, somewhat
could be euphoric, sensational.

Combining two doesn&#8217;t take a genius to understand how the result would
sound like.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Techno</span><span
class='gsl-title'>384,624 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>The first
proto-Techno/Electro release was Cybotron&#8217;s &#8216;Alleys Of Your

Of Names&#8217; released another important and influentional song called
&#8216;Sharivari&#8217;. While both of those songs aren&#8217;t pure Techno,
they are the roots of the sound and a very important part of the history.

The term Techno (specifically relating to the music genre) was first used on
the 1984 EP by Cybotron called &#8216;Techno City&#8217;. It was also used
on the 1988 compilation &#8216;Techno! The New Dance Sound Of
Detroit&#8217;. Juan Atkins, one half of Cybotron, was the first person to
use the term to specifically describe the regional dance sound of Detroit.
Atkins and the other purveyors of the sound &#8211; Derrick May, Kevin
Saunderson, and Eddie Fowlkes &#8211; comprise what is known as &#8216;The
First Wave&#8217; (pre-1988).

Other notable early artists are Blake Baxter, James Pennington, and Anthony
Shakir. The second wave of Techno artists, from 1988 onward, notably
consisted of Jeff Mills, Mike Banks (of Underground Resistance), Carl Craig,
Richie Hawtin, Rob Hood, Dave Angel, Kenny Larkin, Dan Bell, Drexciya,
Stacey Pullen, Orlando Voorn, Kelli Hand, and Octave One (to name just a

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Trance</span><span
class='gsl-title'>244,101 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Trance
emerged as a form of electronic dance music around 1990, with the advent of
music that was essentially techno or house, but had simplified percussion,
extreme repetition, and other hypnotic effects such as sustained chords and
long echoes. Trance generally has no &#8220;bump&#8221; in its percussion or
&#8220;groove&#8221; in its basslines &#8212; that is, the hi-hats and the
bass in the kick drum are generally de-emphasized as compared to house or
techno, and the basslines tend to consist of flat tones, with no modulation,
confined to a small range of notes. Trance tempos are generally a little
faster than techno, but can vary considerably. Additional info: Trance
Production section of the Trance article on Wikipedia.

In trance&#8217;s early years (1990-1992), it wasn&#8217;t always clear
whether a track was just &#8220;trancey&#8221; techno (or even beat-laden
&#8220;ambient&#8221; or &#8220;deep&#8221; house), or was actually an
example of what would later be called simply &#8220;trance&#8221;.
Consequently, on Discogs, such music might be tagged as (for example) both
Trance and Techno. Example artists in this category and time period include
The Shamen, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia, The Irresistible Force, and Speedy J.
From the New Beat scene, Age of Love&#8217;s 1990 self-titled hit single is
sometimes pointed to as the earliest &#8220;pure&#8221; trance track.
Similarly, some tracks from the Acid House era, such as original versions of
The KLF&#8217;s &#8220;What Time Is Love?&#8221; (issued in sleeves that say
&#8220;Pure Trance&#8221;) were called house or acid house at the time, but
are retroactively considered by some to be trance or proto-trance.

The first wave of what many now consider to be &#8220;classic&#8221; trance
peaked in 1992 and waned in 1994, and was dominated by producers and labels
from Germany and the UK. Key labels include Eye Q/Harthouse, Rising High,
FAX, ESP, and MFS. Hits include Jam &#038; Spoon &#8220;Stella&#8221;,
Jaydee &#8220;Plastic Dreams&#8221;, Sequential &#8220;Prophet&#8221;,
Transform &#8220;Transformation&#8221;, Cygnus X &#8220;Superstring&#8221;.
Other artists of note from this wave include Sven Väth, Cosmic Baby, The
Drum Club, The Sabres of Paradise, Horizon 222, Biosphere, Lumukanda, James
Bernard, and Oliver Lieb. On Discogs, this music is generally tagged as just
Trance.

In the mid-1990s, although it wasn&#8217;t new, harder-edged, faster, more
aggressive sounding trance (Hard Trance, Acid Trance) became more popular
than the mellower, more tonal classic sound. Similarly, it was in the
mid-1990s that busier, more psychedelic/ear-candy-laden forms of trance
became the norm rather than the exception. On Discogs, this music is
generally tagged according to which style it is Goa Trance, Progressive
Trance, and Psy-Trance), but plain old Trance can be used if the specific
variety isn&#8217;t known. When these styles became more popular, the more
basic, classic sound became marginalized, and it did not really re-emerge
until the early 2000s, when classic trance-infused techno/tech-house
(sometimes called Neo-Trance) became popular. This newer sound is generally
tagged with Trance, along with whatever other style applies, indicating it
has elements of both.

Meanwhile, the mid and late 1990s also saw commercial, &#8220;clubby&#8221;
forms of trance or trance/house hybrids become very popular, especially in
Europe. These tracks often include vocals, overt melodies, and traditional
A-A-B-A song structures, and may include remixes of 1980s pop hits. This
category of commercial trance music encompasses a range of styles, and
boundaries are a bit blurred. Tags on such items tend to include, in various
combinations, Progressive Trance, Progressive House, Euro House, Trance,
House, and sometimes Techno. Example artists in this commercial/clubby
category from the late 1990s and early 2000s include DJ Tiësto, Ferry
Corsten, ATB, William Orbit, Dirty Vegas, Tall Paul, Peter Rauhofer.</span>

house music combined with world music, tribal house is characterised by
heavy use of percussion (typically conga drums or their synthesized
derivative) over a house tempo (120/125 BPM).

Tribal house roots are primarily in Florida, where the Caribbean percussive
sound hugely influenced the post-electro scene; Rey Rodriguez, Tony
Carrasco, MURK and George Acosta were the forerunners there and contributed
to establishing Miami as a major clubbing town. Tribal house gained
popularity from the early 90s into the early 00s, especially in New York,
due to producers like Kenny &#8220;Dope&#8221; Gonzalez, Eric Kupper (alias
K-Scope), Danny Tenaglia, Hex Hector and Mac Quayle (alias HQ2), Barry
Harris and Chris Cox (alias Thunderpuss), Peter Rauhofer (alias Club 69),
Little Louie Vega, Ralphi Rosario and Abel Aguilera (alias Rosabel), Victor
Calderone and Junior Vasquez, amongst others.

There is also a Benelux school, which is a legacy of carnival tradition
similar as in Central &#038; South America; the labels Wonka Beats, Touché,
Outland and Global Cuts are representatives of it. The London UK school
takes more influences from Jamaican sounds like raggamuffin and integrated
them in progressive house with leftfield; examples being Fabio Paras and
KLF.</span></li>

Bristol. It has been described as &#8220;a fusion of hip hop and electronica
until neither genre is recognizable&#8221;, and may incorporate a variety of

Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the
British music media to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat
emerging from the Bristol Sound scene in the early 1990s, which contained
influences of soul, funk, and jazz. It was pioneered by acts like Massive
Attack, Tricky, and Portishead. Trip hop achieved commercial success in the
1990s, and has been described as &#8220;Europe&#8217;s alternative choice in

(also known as UKG) is a genre of electronic music originating from England
in the early 1990s. The genre usually features a distinctive syncopated 4/4
percussive rhythm with &#8216;shuffling&#8217; hi-hats and beat-skipping
kick drums. Garage tracks also commonly feature &#8216;chopped up&#8217; and
time-shifted or pitch-shifted vocal samples complementing the underlying
rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 128 to 140 BPM. UK garage was
largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s,
including dubstep, bassline and grime. The decline of UK garage during the
mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related.

class='gsl-title'>17,774 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Vaporwave is
a genre that emerged in the early 2010s. It is often characterized by a
nostalgic fascination with retro cultural aesthetics, commercial fragments,
and technology, as well as a critical or parodic preoccupation with consumer
capitalism, popular culture, &#8217;80s yuppie culture, and new-age tropes.

Vaporwave grew out of styles such as witch house and chillwave, as well as
related internet communities. Musically, it is often characterized by its
heavy use of samples from late &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, &#8217;90s and early
2000s popular music as well as lounge, smooth jazz or elevator music.
Samples are often pitched, layered or altered in classic chopped and screwed
style.

Vaporwave is also home to a multitude of sub-genres, which include the
following: mallsoft, which combines the typical vaporwave style with a
reverb-heavy, atmospheric sound, and utilizes themes of shopping and the
buildings in which it occurs &#8211; vaportrap, which typically puts ambient
synths and pads with trap-styled drum patterns atop its samples &#8211;
future funk, a more upbeat take on vaporwave that is reminiscent of nu-disco
both in production and sound &#8211; vapornoise, which typically lathers the
original vaporwave style with distortion and glitches &#8211; broken
transmission, a sub-genre that takes any one of these styles (typically the
chopped-and-screwed approach) and applies it to samples taken from
commercials and similar media &#8211; utopian virtual, an approach that
tends to involve sounds akin to MIDI sequencing and a heavily electronic
sound, mostly themed around the concept of perfect life &#8211; hypnagogic
drift, a more ambient take on the chopped-and-screwed style, making copious
use of phasers and delay &#8211; late night lo-fi, a style that primarily
samples funk and R&#038;B to create a soulful atmosphere, and VHS pop, a
style that combines the typical vaporwave style with punchy hip-hop
beats.</span></li>

features use of synthesizers, drum machines, obscure samples, droning
repetition and heavily altered, ethereal, indiscernible vocals. The witch
house visual aesthetic includes occult, witchcraft, shamanism and
horror-inspired artworks, collages and photographs as well as significant
use of typographic elements such as Unicode symbols. Many works by witch
house visual artists incorporate themes from horror films, the television
series Twin Peaks, and mainstream pop culture celebrities. Common
typographic elements in artist and track names include triangles, crosses,

music genre that originated in Ghana at the turn of the 20th century and
incorporated the traditional harmonic 9th, as well as melodic and the main
rhythmic structures in traditional Akan music, and married them with Western
instruments. Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy
during the colonial period. By 1930s, Highlife spread to Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Gambia and Nigeria via Ghanaian workers, amongst other West African
countries, where the music is now very popular.

Highlife is characterized by jazzy horns and multiple guitars which lead the
band. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound (see Daddy
Lumba). Igbo highlife and Joromi are subgenres.

This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is modeled after an Afro-Cuban guajeo.
The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 clave motif
guajeo as shown below. The bell pattern known in Cuba as clave is indigenous
to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in Highlife.

(various other spellings include Kronchong, Kroncong, etc.) is a popular
music style which originated in the region now known as Malaysia and
Indonesia. It was reputedly derived from local attempts to copy Portuguese
popular songs brought to Malacca by traders and usually involved the use of
stringed instruments. A local variant on the European lute resembling a
ukulele was called the keroncong, so this may be how the style acquired its
name.

Obvioulsy the style must have developed considerably over the time between
the earliest European influences in the 16th century and modern times but
there are no recorded examples before the early 20th century. By the time
the earliest recordings were made (in Singapore in 1903 by The Gramophone
Co. and in Batavia and Singapore in 1906 by Beka) keroncong was primarily a
vocal style. Many similar recordings were made up until the early 1940s when
all recording activity stopped due to the Japanese invasion of Southeast
Asia. By this time accompaniments varied considerably and were not
necessarily by the traditional group of stringed instruments (in some cases
more modern instruments like the piano and saxophone were used). On most
recordings the term keroncong applies to any popular vocal in the keroncong
style whether stringed instruments were involved or not.

After WWII the recording of this style continued, but post-war recordings
already show some new developments. While most pre-war keroncong records are
played fast and sung in a high-pitched nasal voice, later recordings tend to
be slower in tempo and the singing style is also different (becoming more
similar to other forms of popular songs of that time). The keroncong style
was still popular, but it began to lose it&#8217;s dominant role in the
local culture as other types of music gained more influence.

For post-war recordings if the performance is not specified as keroncong (or
some variant of that term) this tag should not be used. Although recordings
of keroncong music continue up to the present day, by the late 1970s it had
been largely overtaken by other forms. In the 1970s &#038; 1980s the
dominant form in Indonesia was Dangdut. Although both Keroncong and Dangdut
are well known forms of Indonesian popular music, they should be regarded as
distinct styles and these tags would not normally be used together.</span>

class='gsl-title'>3,349 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Min&#8217;yō
/ Minyou is generic name of Japanese old trad song.
Since Min&#8217;yō is Japanese original music that continues from
ancient times to the present, it does not have a Western scale
and Western instruments are not used.
As rare case, singer sometimes sing along with Western instruments for
contemporary music, but it will be Kayōkyoku.
Fusion, Jazz, and Easy Listening also has cover of Min&#8217;yo songs using
Western instruments.
Even Disco and Funk have cover of Min&#8217;yo songs. They are crossover
music using Min&#8217;yo famous songs.

The Western scale is seven scales. However, the Japanese scale is five
scales.
The Japanese scale &#8220;ヨナ抜き&#8221; (Yona-nuki : &#8220;Yo&#8221; means 4,
&#8220;Na&#8221; means 7, &#8220;Nuki&#8221; means Without)
It without using 4 &#8220;Fa&#8221; and 7 &#8220;Si&#8221;.
Also other Japanese scale &#8220;ニロ抜き&#8221; (Niro-nuki : &#8220;Ni&#8221;
means 2, &#8220;Ro&#8221; means 6, &#8220;Nuki&#8221; means Without)
It without using 2 &#8220;Re&#8221; and 6 &#8220;La&#8221;.
The vocal does not have Kobushi (Enka vibrato).
You can judge Min&#8217;yō from this sound.
Or in many cases 民謡 is printed on cover and label so you can judge
Min&#8217;yō.
民謡 is old trad song from all over Japan.
The area name is printed next to &#8220;民謡&#8221; credit.

These are the types of Minyou.

追分 Oiwake means the branch point of the Japanese country road.
It is a traditional song that was sung in that area.
As a musical characteristic of 追分 Oiwake,
Rhythm does not have a clear meter (You can not hit a crap hand well)
Wide range (there are many songs from high voice to low voice)
Extend the vowel (one-tone and multiple-voice type, often one character of
lyrics etc.
is extended for a long time like a Melisma)

甚句 Zinku (都々逸 Dodoitsu)
It is estimated that it occurred during the Edo period.
It is characterized by lyrics constituting 1 chorus
with 7, 7, 7 and 5 (都々逸 Dodoitsu).
Various lyrics were invented. 5, 7, 7, 5 in some cases.
Many folk songs throughout the country have this form.
There are both a melisma type and a syllable type.
A shout is inserted, which is often inserted before and after lyrics.

シマ唄 Shima-uta is Min&#8217;yō from 鹿児島県奄美群島 (Amami Islands)
which 沖縄 Okinawa and 鹿児島 Kagoshima people&#8217; trad song.

And 労働歌 Roudouka = Work song. It belong under the Min&#8217;yō.
These traditional work songs are songs that have been inherited by workers
from a long time ago.

馬子唄 Mago-Uta is a song for a person to sing while leading a horse.
It also called 馬追い歌 (Umaoi-Uta)、馬喰節 (Bakurou-Bushi).
Many lyrics are in Zinku style (1 chorus with 7, 7, 7 and 5)
It is difficult because it has melisma style and does not have a constant
rhythm.
Likewise, cow songs fall into this category.

舟歌 Funa-Uta is Sailor&#8217;s song. It’s kind of Work song.

木遣唄 Kiyari-Uta is song for carrying heavy logs,
workmen&#8217;s chant while pulling a heavy load.

地突唄 Zitsuki-Uta, According to Japanese trad music classification,
it is one of work songs. It&#8217;s the workers singing with shout
when hardening the construction site before building the house.
We will hang a weight of about 112.5 kilograms by assembling a large wooden
scaffold.
16 to 30 people with rope attached to this are pulled up rhythmically
when singing it with shout. This will facilitate integration of work.

ユンタ Yunta is is a form of trad song transmitted to

盆踊りの歌 Bon-Odori song,
Bon Odori meaning simply Bon dance, is a style of dancing performed during
Obon.
Originally a Nenbutsu folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead,
the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region.
Each region has a local dance, as well as different music.
The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of
Obon,
or local min&#8217;yō folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look
and sound different from region to region.

音頭 Ondo,
An &#8220;Ondo,&#8221; usually refers to a kind of song with a distinct
swung 2/2 rhythm.
This &#8220;swing&#8221; can be referred to as &#8220;Ukare&#8221; in
Japanese.
&#8220;Ondo&#8221; is a term used in older Japanese genres,
but it is still used today when referring to songs written in this swinging
style.
Sometimes the rhythm is NOT swung and it is played straight through. This is
called &#8220;Kizami&#8221;.
There are other names used to describe older Japanese genres of music.
For example, &#8220;Fushi&#8221; or &#8220;Bushi&#8221; (節), with its
literal meaning of &#8220;node,&#8221; &#8220;knuckle,&#8221;
or &#8220;joint,&#8221; refers to the nodes found in bamboo,
usually found at a steady sequence.
Thus &#8220;Fushi&#8221; can also have the abstract idea of
&#8220;sequence&#8221; to refer to notes
and beats in a sequence, i.e., a melody.

Not every old Japanese melody with a swung rhythm is called an
&#8220;Ondo,&#8221;
as sometimes the term &#8220;Fushi&#8221; or &#8220;Bushi&#8221; is used to
refer to a tune
with a swung 2/2 rhythm, both of these having more or less the same meaning
of &#8220;tune&#8221; or &#8220;melody.&#8221; The folk song Goshu Ondo,
for example, does not follow this rule, as the rhythm is NOT played in a
swung fashion.
The folk song Tankō Bushi has a swung 2/2 rhythm,
even though it has &#8220;bushi&#8221; in its name.

In Japanese folk music, &#8220;Fushi&#8221; and &#8220;Ondo&#8221; follow
the name of the song.
For example, Tokyo Ondo, Mamurogawa Ondo,

Part of the Japanese Obon celebration involves participating in the local
community dance.
The tradition of the Bon dance, or Bon odori (盆踊り), dates back a few hundred
years,
and it is usually accompanied by the local tune.
In recent times, new music has been used for Bon dance accompaniment,
including late enka hits and music written specifically for bon dancing.
The &#8220;Ondo&#8221; rhythm has always been common in Japanese folk music,
but even the newer music written for Bon dances has been written in this
style.

It is common to find names of newer music with the word &#8220;Ondo&#8221;
attached to it.
For example, Japanese franchises such as anime, video games and
Tokusatsu TV series have their own ondo: the Pokémon Ondo, the Naruto Ondo,
the Hunter x Hunter Ondo, the Doraemon Ondo, Ojamajo Doremi Ondo,
Shiawase Kyoryu Ondo, the Love Live! Sunshine!! Sunshine Pikkapika Ondo
and even the Super Sentai series has several Ondo songs
such as Carranger Ondo, Bomb Dancing Megaranger, Hurricane Ondo,
Bakuryu Kazoeuta, Let&#8217;s Go On-do, Minna Summer DAY Ondo, Kyutama Ondo.
There is fan-made Touhou Ondo and DoDonPachi Ondo.
Ondo were commonly used as the opening themes for anime in the 1960s and
70s,
especially with Tatsunoko Productions.
Even non-ondo music is starting to make the bon dance scene.
The selection ranges from traditional sounding Enka,
such as Hikawa Kiyoshi&#8217;s &#8220;Zundoko-bushi,&#8221; to more modern
non-Japanese hits,
such as the Beach Boys&#8217; &#8220;Kokomo.&#8221;

音頭 Ondo is a congratulatory song. For that reason Japanese major record
companies have 演歌 Enka singers singing 音頭 Ondo. Because 音頭 Ondo belongs to
舞踊 Buyō, and it must be 民謡 Min&#8217;yō for the style. However, 音頭 Ondo
which has been released in recent years has no 民謡 Min&#8217;yō identity due
to the diversity of Western musical instruments. It should be a 歌謡曲
Kayōkyok.

騒ぎ唄 Sawagi-Uta.
Geisha sing to play with customers. Tempo is fast, lively and bright sound.
Geisha sang this to warm banquet up with shamisen and Japanese drum.

今様 Imayou / Imayō
A style of Japanese old songs. 今様 Imayou / Imayō means &#8220;Modern and
Contemporary&#8221;
and it was the name meaning &#8220;Modern epidemic song&#8221; at the time.
In the Heian period (794 &#8211; 1185)
今様 Imayou / Ima yō occurred in the middle of the Heian period.
In the latter half of the Heian period, it was left in the record of the
history book
that 後白河天皇 (Emperor Go-Shirakawa) loved it,
he was too passionate and had sore throat for 今様 Imayou / Imayō.
The lyrics are characterized by 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7 and 5 constituting one
chorus,
and various lyrics were produced. Songs are syllables and melisma types.

Geisha sings old Japanese songs in response to customer requests.
That is not necessarily only Minyou.
Geisha was singing 歌謡曲 Kayōkyoku、長唄 Naga-Uta、
清元 Kiyomoto / Kiyomoto-bushi、民謡 Minyou、端唄 Ha-Uta、
小唄 Kouta、宮薗節 Miyazono-bushi / 薗八節 Sonohachi-bushi.
If 三味線 Shamisen is used, these kinds are often collectively called
Min&#8217;yō / Minyou.

These all are the 舞踊 Buyō that geisha sang. It belongs to 民謡 Min&#8217;yō.

長唄 Naga-Uta, The official name is 江戸長唄 (Edo Nagauta).
長唄 Naga-Uta, literally &#8220;long song&#8221;, is a kind of traditional
Japanese music which accompanies the kabuki theater. It was developed around
1740. Influences included the vocal yōkyoku style used in noh theater, and
instruments included the shamisen and various kinds of drums.

小唄 Kouta, The official name is 江戸小唄 (Edo Kouta).
小唄 Kouta is 俗謡 (Popular song) originally derived from the 端唄 Ha-Uta.
It was the Meiji (1868 &#8211; 1912) to Taisho (1912 &#8211; 1926) years
that established as an abbreviation.
端唄 Ha-Uta uses 撥 Bachi (the plectrum for stringed instruments such as the
shamisen and biwa) for the shamisen.
But 小唄 Kouta is finger picking.
In some cases, &#8220;小撥 Ko-Bachi&#8221; (Small Bachi) may be used.
端唄 Ha-Uta uses percussion instruments.
But 小唄 Kouta is a song only with a shamisen.
In recent years, there are also playing percussion instruments in special
cases.
端唄 Ha-Uta sings flat. But 小唄 Kouta sings skillfully.
In this case, in order to give out the coolness which is the characteristic
of the song, this technique must be not disgusting and disconcerting.

端唄 Ha-Uta is a collective term for short songs from the middle of the Edo
period (1603 to1868).
Until the 1920s, songs were also called by the name of 小唄 Kouta,
but later it became clearly distinguishable from 端唄 Ha-Uta / 小唄 = 俗謡
(Popular song). It was the Meiji (1868 &#8211; 1912) to Taisho (1912 &#8211;
1926) years that established as an abbreviation.

清元 Kiyomoto / Kiyomoto-bushi is one of the shamisen music,
a kind of 浄瑠璃 Jōruri (Jōruri is a form of traditional Japanese narrative
music in which a 太夫 tayū sings to the accompaniment of a shamisen. As a form
of storytelling, the emphasis is on the lyrics and narration rather than the
music itself.) It is mainly used as accompaniment music of 歌舞伎 Kabuki and
歌舞伎舞踊 Kabuki Buyō (Kabuki&#8217;s dance tune).

宮薗節 Miyazono-bushi / 薗八節 Sonohachi-bushi.
One of the old songs of 浄瑠璃 Jōruri, the ancestor of 宮古路 薗八 (Sonohachi
Miyakoji. the first generation, unknown birth and death year) in the middle
of the Edo period (1603 to1868).

(Azerbaijani: Muğam) is one of the many folk musical compositions from
Azerbaijan, contrasting with tasnif and ashiks.

It is a highly complex art form that weds classical poetry and musical
improvisation in specific local modes. Mugham is a modal system.Unlike
Western modes, &#8220;mugham&#8221; modes are associated not only with
scales but with an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic
fragments that performers use in the course of improvisation. Mugham is a
compound composition of many parts. The choice of a particular mugham and a
style of performance fits a specific event. The dramatic unfolding in
performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising
pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and
initiated listeners.</span></li>

is an umbrella term used to refer to the music of the Sephardic Jewish
community. Sephardic Jews have a diverse repertoire the origins of which
center primarily around the Mediterranean basin. In the secular tradition,
material is usually sung in dialects of Judeo-Spanish, though other
languages including Hebrew, Turkish, Greek, and other local languages of the
Sephardic diaspora are widely used. Sephardim maintain geographically unique
liturgical and para-liturgical traditions.

Songs which are sung by women are traditionally sung while performing
household tasks, without accompaniment or harmony. Tambourines and other
percussion instruments are sometimes used, especially in wedding songs. Oud
and qanún are also used in some instrumentations of Sephardic music, and
more modern performers incorporate countless other imported
instruments.</span></li>

(German: literally, &#8220;people&#8217;s music&#8221; or as a Germanic
connotative translation, &#8220;folk&#8217;s music&#8221;) is the common
umbrella designation of a number of related styles of traditional folk music
from the Alpine regions of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia and South
Tyrol (Italy). It tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional
lifestyles and traditions, particularly those of the Alpine farmers and
peasants.
Originally transmitted by oral tradition, the oldest historical records like
the Appenzell Kuhreihen by Georg Rhau (1488–1548) date back to the 16th
century. Volksmusik is characterized by improvisation and variation,
uncomplicated major key melodies and simple harmonies. Typical instruments
range from alpenhorns to hackbretts, zithers and acoustic guitars, and even
violas and harmonicas. Harmonized singing is frequent, but other pieces may
require yodeling, while instrumental arrangements are particularly frequent
for fast dances or brass pieces.
Volksmusik continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands
throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with Volkstümliche
Musik, which is largely to be found in broadcasting media and on ancillary
merchandise. Since the 1970s, artists of a Neue Volksmusik genre, such as
Werner Pirchner or Biermösl Blosn, attempt to combine traditional styles
with jazz, folk, hip hop, rock et al. as a kind of world music. Popular
proponents include Hubert von Goisern, Attwenger and Christine Lauterburg.
Additionally, also e.g. a Czech variant (Oberkrainer, Dechovka) does exist.
There has been much mix-up for this style, since &#8216;Volksmusik&#8217; is
the verbatim translation of &#8216;Folk music&#8217;. This style, however is
very specific, the correct translation for &#8216;Folk music&#8217; into
German is &#8216;volkstümliche Musik&#8217;. This discrepancy is described
amongst others in the German Wikipedia article. The requested style is the
specific style for the alpine branch, well described by the English
Wikipedia aricle.</span></li>

music genre that originated in the mid to late 1960s when African-American
musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture
of soul music, jazz, and R&#038;B. Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and
brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the
foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single
chord, distinguishing them from R&#038;B and soul songs, which are built on
chord progressions. Funk uses the same extended chords found in bebop jazz,
such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh
chords with altered ninths.

Hop style, see Miami Bass or read further down below.

For the Electronic style: Bass Music is an umbrella term that refers to
various styles of music including drum and bass, bassline, dubstep and UK
garage among others. The phrase began to be used in response to the blending
of sounds between these genres. The key characteristic shared among these
genres are an emphasis on basslines, groove and rhythm.

Hip Hop Bass Music (sometimes referred to as Miami Bass) is a musical style
that originated in the U.S. State of Florida in the mid-eighties. It is
directly linked with electro-funk music from the early eighties and is known
for its use of the Roland TR-808 kickdrums, sped up tempo and frequently
sexually explicit lyrical content.

The style originated in Miami&#8217;s historically black neighborhoods such
as Liberty City and Overtown, but also had shared influence from nearby Ft.
Lauderdale, as well as Tampa Bay and Orlando. Maggotron a.k.a DXJ, Maggozulu
2, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Khan are considered pioneers of the sound,
while it was popularized by acts such as the 2 Live Crew, Jam Pony Express,
Gucci Crew II and DJ Magic Mike. Other well-known artists of the genre
include the 69 Boyz, Truck Stop Boyz and the Quad City DJ&#8217;s

In the mid-eighties pirate radio was popular in Miami, where DJ&#8217;s
would hijack radio airwaves and broadcast provocative and sexually explicit
bass music from the safety of nearby boats off of the coast. This helped the
style to gain further recognition, while adding to its controversial appeal.
The style eventually spread to neighboring States, such as Georgia (mainly
Atlanta) and the Carolinas as well as other nearby States.</span></li>

American hip-hop and R&#038;B. It is the most popular musical style amongst

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Boom Bap</span><span
class='gsl-title'>14,122 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Boom bap is
a style of production in hip-hop music. The term &#8220;boom bap&#8221; is
an onomatopoeia for the drum sounds prominent in boom bap. It is usually
recognized by an acoustic drum loop/break that is then chopped up and played
using a sampler such as the Akai MPC or the SP1200. The term was popularized
by the album Return of the Boom Bap by KRS-One.
Boom bap production was associated with producers from New York City in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, KRS-One, Q-tip,
Ali Shaheed Muhammad, EPMD, RZA, Marley Marl, Large Professor, Prince Paul
and Scott La Rock. The production style was also employed by producers
outside of New York City, such as J Dilla in Detroit and People Under The
Stairs in Los Angeles.

Although it is still made, boom bap is no longer the dominant style of
hip-hop production, remaining somewhat prominent in alternative hip hop but
rarely appearing in Top 40 hip hop singles.[citation needed] In recent years
the boom bap production style has made a slight comeback through artists
such as Joey Bada$$,[1] Pro Era and associated acts.
·Having a &#8220;drunken&#8221; or &#8220;trippy&#8221; quality to its
rhythm. Most other hip-hop beats has even eighth and sixteenth notes, but
many examples of boom-bap are only even at the quarter note level &#8212;
the eighth notes may be offbeat.

·Soul music, jazz, R&#038;B and reggae sampling is utilized. This could be
said about 90s hip-hop in general though. Boom-bap beats are most often
funky.

·Relatively less dense drum loops. Often, a boom-bap measure is just quarter
notes (kick-snare-kick-snare). Eighth-notes are less emphasized but are
crucial to making the boom-bap sound because they are placed offbeat to
create that drunken or trippy quality. However, less dense drums does not
mean it&#8217;s simpler &#8212; it takes craftsmanship to find samples that
go well with snare drums.

·Pick-up notes. They tend to be very close to the upbeat of the note it
picks up to, especially noticeable in the kick drum. Sometimes the note it
picks up to is even substituted completely by the pick-up note.</span></li>

sub-genre of rap that started in the projects of New Orleans, Louisiana.
During its first years it did not have an official name, however sometime
between (or after) DJ Jimi’s record and Everlasting Hitman’s “Bounce Baby,
Bounce!”, everybody started calling the genre ‘bounce’.

DJ Jimi, MC T Tucker &#038; DJ Irv are considered ‘founding fathers’ of
bounce, although it started with artists rapping over a DJ looping breaks
from The Showboys’ “Drag Rap” record (which is colloquially referred to as
“Triggerman”).

While typically comprised from samples of “Triggerman”, The Soul Searchers’
“Ashley’s Roach Clip”, and/or Derek B’s “Rock The Beat (Bonus Beats)” (or
Cameron Paul’s “Brown Beat”, which is the same as Derek B’s “Rock The Beat
(Bonus Beats)” but with various James Brown samples added to it), Bounce is
more of a transparent expression of cultural aspects of New Orleans:
Secondlines, party music, hood representation, call and response, comedy,
witty lyrics, roast sessions, dances, chants, etc. &#8211; a good, ‘hood’
(and sometimes raunchy) cultural celebration.

The first known bounce recording that was distributed to the public was DJ
Irv’s “Live At Ghosttown” tape which featured a 15-minute version of “Where
Dey AT?” by MC T Tucker.</span></li>

<a href='https://www.discogs.com/style/britcore'>
<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Britcore</span><span
class='gsl-title'>1,503 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Britcore is a
subgenre of Hip Hop which stands for British Hardcore Hip Hop.

The term came up in the early 90&#8217;s (from the maker of German hip hop
magazine MZEE &#8211; Ralf Kotthoff) and was adapted by the European scene
(got mentioned in magazines, on flyers, releases, lyrics).
Two of the earliest releases of that subgenre were &#8216;Hold No
Hostage&#8217; by &#8216;Hijack&#8217; and &#8216;Bring Forth The
Guillotine&#8217; by &#8216;Silver Bullet&#8217;, both later classified as
Britcore.

The majority of crews came from the UK but the main market appeared to be
the European mainland, especially Germany and Switzerland.
So were some crews releasing their records on German labels towards the mid
90&#8217;s (Gunshot, Killa Instinct, First Down, Suspekt, Blade).
The Britcore style was adapted by bands from other countries, mainly Germany
and The Netherlands but there also have been bands in Switzerland, Belgium
and other European countries, such as Sweden or Norway.

The lyrics are mostly in English, even from those crews not being from the
UK. But there has been a minority of crews rapping in their native language,
for example in Dutch or German.
In Germany the term Germcore came up but didn&#8217;t prevail, although the
Germans invented their own style and a lot of crews were overproducing their
beats and rapping on beats up to 165 BPM.

Towards the mid 90&#8217;s the support for the scene in the UK decreased and
to the end of the 90&#8217;s the strong Britcore scene on the European
mainland was nearly not existent anymore.

Due to the internet and the ability to bundle the interest in Britcore there
has been a little revival of Britcore and old crews revived (new releases of
Killa Instinct, Dookie Squad, The Criminal Minds, Hideouz Newcome, Suspekt
to name a few) as well as a few new bands were formed and Jams appeared all
over Europe.
From back then up to today, Britcore stands for originality, unwillingness
to compromise and riotousness.

Britcore is way faster than &#8216;usual&#8217; hip hop, often about 110-130
BPM or even faster. It&#8217;s mostly based on funk breaks and is using
samples from movies such as horror movies. The rapping is aggressive and
fast (mainly male rappers), tongues twisting was used by several MC&#8217;s.
The lyrics were higher-than-average political, sociocritical and often based
on the movie theme that was used (horror, war etc).
A Britcore groups appearance can be very militant. Also, DJ&#8217;s got
longer parts for scratching (even special styles were created such as
&#8216;drills&#8217;) than on &#8216;other&#8217; hip hop tunes, a lot of
crews had more than one DJ (No Remorze, Son Of Noise, Killa Instinct to name
a few). At all Britcore is way more aggressive, more dark and way faster
than other Hip Hop.
It&#8217;s often overproduced (especially the German stuff) and often very
low in sound due to the lack of recording-possibilities and the lack of
money and/or interest from big labels and the music industry. Hardly any
crews appeared on major labels (Hijack, Caveman, Silver Bullet being some of
the very few exceptions here), most crews were either on small independent
labels or used to put out releases on their own, that didn&#8217;t change up
to today. </span></li>

hip hop, or socially conscious hip-hop, is a subgenre of hip hop that
challenges the dominant cultural, political, philosophical, and economic
consensus,[4] and/or comments on social issues and conflicts.

Lyrics are used to create consciousness and awareness with the audience.
Often themes are relating to community, spirituality, economics, and
politics, sometimes with underlying elements of activism, and on the other
end, humour. Generally stemming out a desire for positivity, and to change
the prevailing socio-economic structure. Conscious music seeks to inspire
its listeners, particularly youth, for positive awareness in their lives and
the world we share, if not for action, then simply for awareness through the
dopest music without negative messages. This classic American artform stems
from the blues with rich detailed wordplay about personal growth,
determination, and overcoming great obstacles, storytelling about injustice,
self respect, making mistakes, growing, and sharing of knowledge to raise
people up.</span></li>

<a href='https://www.discogs.com/style/crunk'>
<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Crunk</span><span
class='gsl-title'>3,190 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Crunk is a
subgenre of hip hop music that emerged in the early 1990s and gained
mainstream success during the mid 2000s. Crunk is often up-tempo and one of
Southern hip hop&#8217;s more dance and club oriented subgenres. An
archetypal crunk track frequently uses a main groove consisting of layered
keyboard synths, a drum machine rhythm, heavy basslines, and shouting
vocals, often in a call and response manner. The term &#8220;crunk&#8221; is
also used as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a side
effect of the genre&#8217;s breakthrough to the mainstream. The word derives
from its African-American slang past-participle form, &#8220;crunk&#8221;,
of the verb &#8220;to crank&#8221; (as in the phrase &#8220;crank
up&#8221;).

Outkast has been attributed as the first artist to use the term in
mainstream music, in the 1993 track &#8220;Player&#8217;s Ball&#8221;. A
seminal year for the genre was 1996, with the releases of Three 6 Mafia
album Chapter 1: The End (featuring &#8220;Gette&#8217;m Crunk&#8221;), and
Memphis-based underground hip hop artist Tommy Wright III&#8217;s album On
the Run, which featured the Project Pimp track &#8220;Getting Crunk&#8221;.

Artist Lil Jon was instrumental in bringing the term further into the
mainstream with his 1997 album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. He
later released other songs and albums using the term, and has been credited
by other artists and musicians as galvanizing use of the term as well as
mainstreaming the music genre itself.

Lil Jon further popularized the word with his 2004 album Crunk Juice, and
has been credited with inventing the potent alcoholic cocktail by that name.
This use of &#8220;crunk&#8221; became synonymous with the meaning
&#8220;crazy drunk&#8221;. Non-alcoholic drinks, to which alcohol could be
added, were manufactured and marketed under the Crunk brand name, with Lil
Jon as spokesman.

The term has continued to evolve, taking on a negative stigma with police,
parents and the media. In 2011, the company which manufactured
&#8220;Crunk&#8221; drink brought out an alcoholic version named
&#8220;Crunk Juice&#8221;. This drink was allegedly marketed towards 19- to
21-year-olds – those under the US legal drinking age – resulting in Crunk
Juice drinking being blamed as a cause of crime or becoming a victim of
crime. The mainstream media began publishing stories in which the term
&#8220;crunk&#8221; was used to refer to &#8220;crazy and drunk&#8221;
criminals.

Crunk music arose from Miami bass music before 1996 in the southern United
States, particularly in African American strip clubs of Memphis, Tennessee.
Memphis-based hip hop group Three 6 Mafia were &#8220;instrumental for the
emergence of the crunk style&#8221; in the mid-to-late 1990s. Two mixtape
DJs from Memphis, DJ Paul and Juicy J, started making their original music,
which was distinctive with its &#8220;spare, low-BPM rhythms, simplistic
chants&#8230; and narcotically repetitive, slasher-flick textures&#8221;.
This duo soon became known as Three 6 Mafia. Frequently featuring rappers
such as Project Pat, Lord Infamous, and Gangsta Boo on their releases, they
became instrumental in the formation of crunk music.

In 1997, in Atlanta, Lil Jon, with his group The East Side Boyz, released
their first album titled Get Crunk, Who U Wit. These were the first of six
albums released by Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz. Lil Jon states that they
were first to use the word &#8220;crunk&#8221; in a song hook; he claimed
that they had started to call themselves a &#8220;crunk group&#8221; due to
this album. However, The New York Times denied that Get Crunk, Who Are You
With was the first crunk album ever. He was one of the key figures in
popularizing crunk during 1998 and 1999, and produced two gold records
independently, before signing to TVT Records in 2001. After being named the
&#8220;King of Crunk&#8221;, Lil Jon went on to make collaborations with
many popular artist such as Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Ludacris and Britney
Spears. Nevertheless, crunk was not exclusively associated with Lil Jon and
Three 6 Mafia. In its early stages, such artists as Ying Yang Twins, White
Dawg, Bone Crusher, Lil Scrappy, Trillville, Youngbloodz and Pastor Troy
from Atlanta, and David Banner from Mississippi also helped to popularize
crunk music.</span></li>

gangsta-funk, is a subgenre of hip hop music that emerged from West Coast
Gangsta rap in the early 1990s, heavily influenced by 1970s funk sound of
artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic.

Originating in Los Angeles, California in the early nineties, G-funk (which
uses funk with an artificially altered tempo) incorporates multi-layered and
melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female
vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched
portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. The lyrical content depended on the
artist and could consist of sex, drugs, violence, vandalism and women, but
also of love for a city, love for friends and relaxing words. There was also
a slurred “lazy” or &#8220;smooth&#8221; way of rapping in order to clarify
words and stay in rhythmic cadence.

Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD
and The Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per
song. Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as &#8220;a style of
generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live
instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no)
sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and
harmonies&#8221;. Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live
musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled him
to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the
sample</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>943 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Hiplife is a
musical style from Ghana (West Africa) that fuses Ghanaian highlife music
with hip hop. Recorded predominantly in the Ghanaian Akan language, hiplife
gainined popularity throughout West Africa and abroad, especially in the
United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, where the
Ghanaian diaspora can be found.

Highlife music evolved in the seventies and early eighties, when people
began fusing traditional Akan folk music with Western pop-music, using
Western instruments. The further evolution of the sound came in the late
eighties/early nineties, when producers such as Jay Q, Zapp Mallet and Chief
G began to incorporate Ghanaian highlife music into their production, thus
creating the sound known as hiplife today. Rapper/MC Reggie Rockstone is
widely considered the Godfather and originator of the hiplife sound.</span>

(/ˈhaɪfiː/ HY-fee) is Oakland slang meaning &#8220;hyperactive&#8221;. More

Originating the San Francisco Bay Area, California in the late nineties. It
is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and has been compared to crunk
music. An individual is said to &#8220;get hyphy&#8221; when they dance in
an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overloud
with other people. The phrase &#8220;to get hyphy&#8221; is similar to the
southern phrase &#8220;to get crunk&#8221;. Those who consider themselves
part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior.

Ghost riding, frequently used in the context of &#8220;ghost riding the

hip hop is hip hop music without vocals. Hip hop as a general rule consists
of two elements: an instrumental track (the &#8220;beat&#8221;) and a vocal
track (the &#8220;rap&#8221;). The artist who crafts the beat is the
producer (or beatmaker), and the one who crafts the rap is the MC (emcee).
In this format, the rap is almost always the primary focus of the song,
providing most of the complexity and variation over a fairly repetitive
beat. Instrumental hip hop is hip hop music without an emcee rapping. This
format gives the producer the flexibility to create more complex, richly
detailed and varied instrumentals. Songs of this genre may wander off in
different musical directions and explore various subgenres, because the
instruments do not have to supply a steady beat for an MC. Although
producers have made and released hip hop beats without MCs since hip
hop&#8217;s inception, those records rarely became well-known. Jazz
keyboardist/composer Herbie Hancock and bassist/producer Bill
Laswell&#8217;s electro-inspired collaborations are notable exceptions.
1983&#8217;s Future Shock album and hit single &#8220;Rockit&#8221; featured
turntablist Grand Mixer D.ST, the first use of turntables in jazz fusion,
and gave the turntablism and record &#8220;scratching&#8221; widespread
exposure. The Mix-Up is the seventh studio album by the Beastie Boys,
released in 2007. The album consists entirely of instrumental performances
and won a Grammy Award in 2008 for Best Pop Instrumental Album.

The release of DJ Shadow&#8217;s debut album Endtroducing&#8230;.. in 1996
saw the beginnings of a movement in instrumental hip hop. Relying mainly on
a combination of sampled funk, hip hop, and film score, DJ Shadow&#8217;s
innovative sample arrangements influenced many producers and musicians.

In the 2000s and 2010s, artists such as RJD2, J Dilla, Pete Rock, Large
Professor, MF Doom, Danny!, Nujabes, Madlib, Wax Tailor, Denver Kajanga, DJ
Krush, Hermitude, and Blockhead have garnered critical attention with
instrumental hip hop albums. Due to the current state of copyright law, most
instrumental hip-hop releases are released on small, independent labels.
Producers often have difficulty obtaining clearance for the many samples
found throughout their work, and labels such as Stones Throw are fraught
with legal problems.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Pop Rap</span><span
class='gsl-title'>59,057 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Pop-rap is a
genre of music fusing the rhythm-based lyricism of hip hop music with pop
music&#8217;s preference for melodious vocals and catchy tunes, which gained
mainstream popularity during the 1990s. The lyrics are often lighthearted,
with choruses similar to those heard in pop music. The influences and roots
of pop rap trace back to late 1980s hip hop artists, such as Run DMC, LL
Cool J, and Beastie Boys.

In the 1980s, rap artists including Run DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J set
up the blueprints and origins of pop-rap as they suddenly broke into the
mainstream. LL Cool J has been described as the very first
&#8220;pop-rapper&#8221; in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985
debut album Radio. MTV has described LL Cool J&#8217;s 1987 single &#8220;I
Need Love,&#8221; as &#8220;one of the first pop-rap crossover hits&#8221;.
Later, rap artists such as Tone Loc, Young MC, and Fresh Prince then made
songs with lots of party tunes and storytelling abilities as they became
very popular. During the 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop
music also began to connect strongly with dance music and R&#038;B.

In the early 1990s, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice broke into the mainstream with
songs like &#8220;U Can&#8217;t Touch This&#8221; and &#8220;Ice Ice
Baby&#8221;, respectively. They caused pop-rap to be &#8220;derided (and,
occasionally, taken to court) for its willingness to borrow&#8221; from
well-known hit singles. By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s rappers such
as Ja Rule fused gangsta rap themes with 1980s pop and soul elements;
pop-rap was dominated by many artists.

During the early 2000s, pop-rap returned with a whole different style. It
then went back into the mainstream with the success of The Black Eyed Peas
who had smash singles such as &#8220;Where Is the Love?&#8221; which came
off their Elephunk album. During the late 2000s, pop-rap had many artists
such as Drake, will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa emerge.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Screw</span><span
class='gsl-title'>4,008 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Chopped and
screwed (very rarely also called screwed and chopped or slowed and throwed),
is a technique of remixing hip hop music which developed in the Houston hip
hop scene in the early 1990s. This is accomplished by slowing the tempo down
to between 60 and 70 quarter-note beats per minute and applying techniques
such as skipping beats, record scratching, stop-time, and affecting portions
of the music to make a &#8220;chopped-up&#8221; version of the original.

DJ Screw is largely recognized as the innovator behind the chopped and
screwed genre. DJ Screw&#8217;s key technique involved playing the same
record on both turntables with a delay between them of one beat and quickly
moving the crossfader side to side. This created an effect where the words
or beats in a song were repeated without interrupting its tempo.

In Houston, a different approach of slowing music down, rather than speeding
it up, developed. It is unknown when DJ Screw definitively created
&#8220;screwed and chopped&#8221; music: Screw said he started slowing music
down in 1990 and also in Tulsa, Oklahoma, DJ Dinero And DJ Z-Nasty helped
popularize chopped and screwed music in the Mid South. There is no debate,
however, that DJ Screw invented the music style.&#8221; He discovered that
dramatically reducing the pitch of a record gave a mellow, heavy sound that
emphasized lyrics to the point of almost storytelling. After messing around
with the sound for a while Screw started making full length &#8220;Screw
Tapes&#8221;. At first the music was only referred to as &#8220;screw
music&#8221;, was limited to the South Side of Houston, and was seen as
laid-back driving music. As Screw&#8217;s tapes started to gain popularity
he started selling his tapes for around $10. Screw was known to feature some
of Houston&#8217;s most renowned rappers from the South Side. This
eventually led to the formation of the Screwed Up Click.

Between 1991 and 1992, there was a large increase in use of purple drank in
Houston. Purple drank has been considered to be a major influence in the
making of and listening to chopped and screwed music due to its perceived
effect of slowing the brain down, giving slow, mellow music its appeal. DJ
Screw, however, repeatedly denounced the claim that one has to use purple
drank to enjoy screwed and chopped music. Screw, a known user of purple
drank, said he came up with chopped and screwed music when high on
marijuana. Purple drank was very popular in Houston because of two factors;
a lot of strict drug laws in Texas kept the more popular drugs like cocaine
and marijuana from crossing state lines which spared Houston the worst
effects of the crack epidemic, and the cheap availability of cough syrup in
supermarkets in the 1980s.

In the mid-1990s, chopped and screwed music started to move to the north
side of Houston by way of DJ Michael &#8220;5000&#8221; Watts, and later OG
RON C. It wasn&#8217;t long until a rivalry between north and south Houston
started over who were the &#8220;originators&#8221; and who were the
&#8220;adopters&#8221;. Michael &#8220;5000&#8221; Watts always gave credit
to DJ Screw as the originator of chopped and screwed music, which is he
calls the genre &#8220;screwed and chopped&#8221;. In the late 1990s, with
the help of P2P groups such as Napster, chopped and screwed music spread to
a much wider audience.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>15,797 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Trap started
in the early 2000s, and it was much closer to standard hip hop than the trap
we know today. The only main difference between the two at this time is that
trap music had different lyrical content. Trap was about creating and
selling crack cocaine in a home dedicated to the cooking/selling of crack
cocaine, which was known as a trap. It still used the same sampling
techniques, but as time went on, producers started making the bass heavier
and heavier. Important artists from this time include Young Jeezy, T.I., and
Gucci Mane. The breaking point was when the big producers of Atlanta
(Zaytoven, Shawty Redd, etc) started to lengthen the release of an 808 drum
machine kick, which when played on speakers that could play low frequencies,
made for very heavy bass. They then started using this lengthened 808 kick
as a bassline, creating the backbone of modern trap music. The quickly timed
and constantly changing rhythm hi hat patterns followed. during this change,
the instrumentation started to abandon traditional hip hop stylings, and
move towards a less sample based, more instrument based production. The
producers started relying heavily on strings and brass to create this new
heavy sound. Eventually, each producer would find their own sound, making
trap a very diverse genre. Over time, trap has become very experimental,
leading to the many different styles we see today.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Turntablism</span><span
class='gsl-title'>2,105 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Turntablism
is the art of manipulating sounds and creating new music, sound effects,
mixes and other creative sounds and beats, typically by using two or more
turntables and a cross fader-equipped DJ mixer. The mixer is plugged into a
PA system for live events and/or broadcasting equipment (if the DJ is
performing on radio, TV or Internet radio) so that a wider audience can hear
the turntablist&#8217;s music. Turntablists manipulate records on a
turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact
points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop,
slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable
platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic &#8220;scratching&#8221; effect
which is a key part of hip hop music), all while using a DJ mixer&#8217;s
crossfader control and the mixer&#8217;s gain and equalization controls to
adjust the sound and level of each turntable. Turntablists typically use two
or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on
different records.

Turntablists, who are often called DJs (or &#8220;deejays&#8221;), generally
prefer direct-drive turntables over belt-driven or other types, because the
belt can be stretched or damaged by &#8220;scratching&#8221; and other
turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive
turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging
the electric motor. The word turntablist was originated by Luis &#8220;DJ
Disk&#8221; Quintanilla (Primus, Herbie Hancock, Invisibl Skratch Piklz).
After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by DJ
Babu to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and mixes
records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus,
turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The
new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop DJing in the 1990s.

John Oswald described the art: &#8220;A phonograph in the hands of a
&#8216;hiphop/scratch&#8217; artist who plays a record like an electronic
washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which
are unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical
instrument.&#8221; Some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat
mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek to
have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting
and improvising with other performers. Depending on the records and tracks
selected by the DJ and his/her turntablist style (e.g., hip hop music), a
turntablist can create rhythmic accompaniment, percussion breaks, basslines
or beat loops, atmospheric &#8220;pads&#8221;, &#8220;stabs&#8221; of sudden
chords or interwoven melodic lines.</span></li>

jazz is the earliest form of Latin jazz. It mixes Afro-Cuban clave-based
rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation.

Afro-Cuban jazz first emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians
Mario Bauzá and Frank Grillo &#8220;Machito&#8221; in the band Machito and
his Afro-Cubans, based in New York City. In 1947, the collaborations of
bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought
Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the tumbadora and the
bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban
music, such as Dizzy&#8217;s and Pozo&#8217;s &#8220;Manteca&#8221; and
Charlie Parker&#8217;s and Machito&#8217;s &#8220;Mangó Mangüé&#8221;, were
commonly referred to as &#8220;Cubop&#8221;, short for Cuban bebop.[1]
During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the
United States than in Cuba itself.[2]

In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later Irakere
brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing new styles

jazz is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art
music and composition with jazz. It originated in the mid- to late 1950s
among a group of improvisors who rejected the conventions of bebop and post
bop in an effort to blur the division between the written and the
spontaneous. It came to be applied to music differing from free jazz,
emphasizing structure and organization by the use of composed melodies,
shifting but nevertheless predetermined meters and tonalities, and
distinctions between soloists and accompaniment. Musicians identified with
this early stage of the style include Cecil Taylor, Lennie Tristano, Jimmy
Giuffre, Sun Ra, and Ornette Coleman.

class='gsl-title'>89,642 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Should be
used to describe recordings by a large orchestra which feature brass
sections with multiple trumpets and trombones and a large reed section. A
feature is that whole sections (the brass, the reeds) often play some parts
of the tune in unison while leaving room for soloists at certain times. This
style of orchestra began to be developed in the early 1920s by prominent
dance band leaders such as Paul Whiteman and Fletcher Henderson, but the
majority of 1920s dance bands were smaller groups and did not play in the
&#8220;big band&#8221; style. It was not until 1929/30 or so that the
majority of dance bands adopted this configuration (examples are the Casa
Loma Orchestra, Mills Blue Rhthm Band, Duke Ellington&#8217;s Orchestra) and
big bands became the norm from the mid-1930s onwards. This style should be
use sparingly before about 1930 as while there were other orchestras
recorded similar to those led by Whiteman and Henderson (already mentioned)
the majority of 1920s dance bands are not &#8220;big bands&#8221;. From the
1930s onwards this style can be applied to recordings by any large
orchestra. There were both jazz big bands (such as Benny Goodman, Tommy
Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Lunceford, Count Basie, etc.) and
&#8220;sweet&#8221; big bands (such as Freddy Martin, Sammy Kaye, and Guy
Lombardo&#8217;s Royal Canadians). This style is often linked to the
&#8220;swing&#8221; style (as in &#8220;big bands of the swing era&#8221;)
but it is better to avoid use the big band and swing tags together as they
do not mean exactly the same thing. In reality not all swing groups were big
bands, and some big bands featured small groups made up of star musicians
from the larger orchestra (Benny Goodman Trio/Quartet/Sextet, Tommy
Dorsey&#8217;s Clambake Seven, Artie Shaw&#8217;s Gramercy Five, etc.) and
it is these smaller groups which played in the &#8220;swing&#8221; style. A
useful distinction is that big band recordings feature large amounts of
section work (notably the brass and/or the reeds) while smaller
&#8220;swing&#8221; groups were more about featured soloists backed by a
rhythm section. The big band style was most prominent during the 1930s and
1940s but was still very popular up into the 1950s and many big band style
recordings continued to be made during the 1960s and later.</span></li>

Contemporary Jazz is essentially a catch-all term for the various
permutations of popular, mainstream jazz of the 1980s and &#8217;90s. While
those years were certainly not devoid of complex, cerebral jazz recordings,
music referred to as contemporary jazz does not usually share those
sensibilities, nor is the term generally used to describe music centered
around hard bop or the avant-garde. Instead, instrumental contemporary jazz
is usually informed by some combination of a) fusion &#8212; often slickly
produced, with an emphasis on rock and funk rhythms; b) pop-jazz, with its
almost exclusive concentration on memorable melodies; c) smooth jazz, with
its primary goal of creating pleasant, mellow textures; and d) crossover
jazz and contemporary funk, with their blend of polished production and
R&#038;B influences. Not all contemporary jazz artists completely discard
improvisation and challenging experimentation, but by and large, most
instrumentalists emphasize shiny production, melody, and accessibility. In
the realm of vocal jazz, artists may or may not possess an improvisational
flair, but in most cases, their recordings attempt to evoke an aura of
stylish sophistication, sometimes drawing upon pop and R&#038;B in addition
to jazz. Taken from Allmusic.com style page.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>42,149 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Free
improvisation is improvised music without any rules beyond the logic or
inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a
technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable
genre in its own right.
## History
Free improvisation, as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in
the mid to late 1960s. The musical advancements made through improvisation
through Free Jazz served as inspiration to European musicians, who then
created &#8220;Free Improvisation&#8221; as a differentiation. Exponents of
free improvised music include saxophonists Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton,
Peter Brötzmann and John Zorn, drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist
George Lewis, guitarists Derek Bailey, Henry Kaiser and Fred Frith and the
improvising groups Spontaneous Music Ensemble, The Art Ensemble of Chicago
and AMM.
## Characteristics
In an atonal context, free improvisation refers to where the focus shifts
from harmony to other dimensions of music: timbre, melodic intervals, rhythm
and the spontaneous interaction between musicians. Although performers may
choose to play in a certain style or key, or at a certain tempo,
conventional songs are highly uncommon in free improvisation; more emphasis
is generally placed on mood, texture or more simply, on performative gesture
than on preset forms of melody, harmony or rhythm. These elements are
improvised at will, as the music progresses.

At the same time, Free Improvisation is a problematic term. It is neither
free nor improvised as in their strict definitions. Musicians who play free
improvisation develop highly individualized musical vocabulary which are
then played without the restriction of a score. In this sense, the freedom
implied by the term Free Improvisation is more of an aesthetic of playing
towards notions of freedom than freedom in the pure sense.

As it has influenced and been influenced by other areas of exploration,
aspects of modern classical music (extended techniques), noise rock
(aggressive confrontation and dissonance), IDM (computer manipulation and
digital synthesis), minimalism and electroacoustic music can now be heard in
free improvisation.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Free Jazz</span><span
class='gsl-title'>37,221 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Free jazz is
an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s.
Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was
dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that
had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Free jazz musicians attempted to
alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed
chord changes or tempos. While usually considered avant-garde, free jazz has
also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often
religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.

Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette
Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John Coltrane.
Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Albert Ayler,
Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Coleman pioneered many techniques
typical of free jazz, most notably his rejection of pre-written chord
changes, believing instead that freely improvised melodic lines should serve
as the basis for harmonic progression in his compositions. Some of bassist
Charles Mingus&#8217;s work was also important in establishing free jazz.

Typically this kind of music is played by small groups of musicians,
although some examples use larger numbers. Other forms of jazz use clear
regular meters and strongly pulsed rhythms. Free jazz normally retains a
general pulsation but without regular meter, and we encounter frequent
accelerando and ritardando, giving an impression of the rhythm moving in
waves. Previous jazz forms used harmonic structures (usually cycles of
diatonic chords). Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures,
but also by definition (it is, after all, &#8220;jazz&#8221; as much as it
is &#8220;free&#8221;) it retains much of the language of earlier jazz
playing.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Ragtime</span><span
class='gsl-title'>11,874 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Ragtime
(sometimes spelled rag-time or rag time) is a musical style that enjoyed its
peak popularity between 1895 and 1919. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated
or &#8220;ragged&#8221; rhythm. Wikipedia

Originally developed in the U.S. in the late 19th century by various
composers of whom one of he best known is Scott Joplin (whose most famous
work is &#8220;Maple Leaf Rag&#8221;). In it&#8217;s earliest period ragtime
was also associated with the cakewalk (a dance). After 1900 the ragtime
style became very popular worldwide and there are many recordings of ragtime
from the UK, Europe and elsewhere in the period before 1920 (but mostly
before WWI).

Ragtime, while an obvious precursor of jazz, is a written [ie. composed]
music rather than an improvised form of music. Despite sharing the
syncopated base that was an essential element in later jazz, ragtime was
performed as written and had a strict form (usually with an &#8220;A&#8221;
section followed by a &#8220;B&#8221; section and then a return to the
&#8220;A&#8221; section &#8211; or some variation of this) and was often
played by military or brass bands. During it&#8217;s peak period (before
1920) most ragtime recordings are by orchestras or bands or are vocal
recordings of ragtime songs. Ragtime recordings can frequently (but not
always) be identified by the use of the word rag or ragtime in the title.

Although rags continued to be recorded in the period from 1920s to the
1940s, ragtime was no longer a common form during this period as jazz and
later big bands or swing had became dominant. The ragtime tag should be used
very sparingly after 1919. It should NOT be applied to any early jazz or
popular music records unless the titles are specifically ragtime
compositions. Just having a rhythmic or syncopated sound does not make a
record ragtime and jazz or pop (or both) would be more appropriate.

During the 1920s &#038; 1930s many recordings of novelty syncopated piano
solos were made by artists such as Zez Confrey, Roy Bargy &#038; Rube Bloom
(in the U.S.) and many others worldwide including Billy Mayerl &#038; Raie
Da Costa (in the UK), Willie Eckstein (in Canada), Jean Wiener &#038;
Clement Doucet (in France), Mischa Spoliansky (in Germany), or Gil Dech
&#038; Beryl Newell (in Australia). While obviously influenced by ragtime
these are not ragtime recordings and should be given the pop tag.

The ragtime influence on jazz was very significant and some early jazz
performers (such as Jelly Roll Morton) both wrote and recorded rags. Some
jazz pianists were more ragtime influenced than others with James P. Johnson
and Thomas Waller (later better known as Fats Waller) recording in what is
known as the stride style, while other jazz piansts such as Earl Hines and
Duke Ellington created totally new styles of jazz piano. The ragtime tag
does not aply to these or other similar jazz records.

By the 1950s interest in the ragtime style was re-emerging and there was
something of a revival with many ragtime compositions being recorded (and
some new ones written and recorded). An off-shoot of the ragtime revival was
Honky-tonk which is not strictly ragtime and is more appropriately tagged
pop.

Ragtime is a very well defined style and the tag should not be applied
broadly unless it is a ragtime composition from the peak peak (1895-1919) or
a ragtime composition recorded later. If jazz, pop or some other tag is
applicable this should be preferred.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Swing</span><span
class='gsl-title'>89,135 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>The swing
style developed in the 1930s and should not be used for earlier records such
as 1920s jazz. While the swing style has its roots in the 1920s as jazz
developed due to the emergence of musicians such as Lous Armstrong, it took
some time for the many different regional jazz styles typical of the 1920s
to evolve into the more unified and sophisticated style known as swing.
Eventually the &#8220;swing craze&#8221; of the mid-1930s when big bands
like Benny Goodman became hugely popular with younger dancers brought jazz
into the mainstream. It is from this period onwards that the swing style can
be applied to many jazz records and while opinions about how to define swing
obviously vary, it is most typified by the many jazz small groups that
recorded from the 1930s onwards (examples are Fats Waller &#038; His Rhythm,
Wing Manone&#8217;s Orchestra, Lionel Hampton&#8217;s Orchestra, and the
many records by the Benny Goodman Trio/Quartet/Sextet). The swing style
began in the U.S. but was quickly adopted by musicians worldwide who made
recordings in their own countries (UK examples would be Joe Daniels &#038;
His Hot Shots or Nat Gonella &#038; His Georgians).

Although many members of the small swing groups worked in big bands, the two
styles are distinct. By definition a big band was a large orchestra of at
least 12 musicians (and often larger), while a typical swing group of the
1930s was usually a trio, quartet or sextet and most swing recording groups
were by at most 7 or 8 musicians. A useful distinction is that a big band
featured soloists in the context of tight arrangements using whole sections
of the orchestra such as the brass or reeds (seperately or together) while a
swing group was more oriented to featuring the musicians as soloists with
the backing of a rhythm section only. Of course in some cases big band
recordings featured soloists extensively, while small band swing records
sometimes featured section work as well as solos &#8211; so there is not
always a clear distinction. However, the swing tag is most usefully applied
to recordings which feature one or more jazz soloists extensively
(especially in a small group context).

The swing style was most popular during the 1930s and 1940s, but swing style
recordings continued to be made well after that period. Mosty swing is
associated with insttumental recordings (although some small band swing
records also featuted vocals) however from the 1940s onwards the role of
jazz or jazz-influenced singers became more dominant and swing can in some
cases also be associated with recordings by pop vocalists such as Ella
Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole.

As early as the 1930s swing blended with other genres to create new music
styles. In country music, artists such as Bob Wills introduced many elements
of swing along with blues to create a genre called Western Swing. In the
blues style there were groups which added elements of swing in their
recordings such as the Harlem Hamfats. Gypsy Jazz is a style based on the
string jazz of Venuti and Lang&#8217;s recordings. Swing revivals have
occurred periodically from the late 1960s to the 2000s. In the late-1980s
(into the early 1990s) a trendier, more urban-styled swing-beat emerged
called New Jack Swing, spearheaded by Teddy Riley. In the late 1990s and
into the 2000s there was a swing revival, led by Squirrel Nut Zippers, Brian
Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and Lavay Smith.</span></li>

Uruguayan music and dance style that comes from African slaves. It is
considered an important aspect of the culture of Uruguay and was recognized
by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage of humanity.

This Uruguayan music style is based on three different drums: chico, repique
and piano drums. This music style is usually played in February during
carnival in Montevideo, Uruguay at dance parades called
&#8220;Llamadas&#8221; and &#8220;Desfile Innaugural del Carnaval&#8221;. In
the late 1960s and early 1970s candombe was mixed with elements from 60s pop
music and bossa nova to create a new genre called candombe beat. The origin
of this genre was largely said to be the work of Eduardo Mateo, a Uruguayan
singer, songwriter and musician. This style was later adopted by Jaime Roos

conjunto music, also known as conjunto tejano, was born in south Texas at
the end of the 19th century, after German settlers introduced the button
accordion. The bajo sexto has come to accompany the button accordion and is
integral to the conjunto sound. Many conjuntos are concentrated in the
Southwestern portion of the United States, primarily in Texas and
California. In Mexico the term conjunto is associated with norteño and
tejano music. Since tejano was bred out of norteño music originally this
association is not entirely false. However, due to various cultural and
socioeconomic developments in the 1900s, norteño musicians began
trailblazing the tejano genre as a tangent to conjunto.

In the United States and Mexico, a conjunto band is composed of four main
instruments: the button accordion, the bajo sexto, an electric bass, and a
drum kit. They are popular in northern Mexico and southern Texas. German and
East European settlers brought their accordions, waltzes and polkas to the
region, which were adapted by the local population. Texas accordion player
Flaco Jiménez is probably the best-known conjunto musician in the United
States, with a career spanning sixty years and earning him six Grammy
awards. &#8220;Chulas Fronteras&#8221; is a documentary film from the 1970s
which illustrates how the music meshed into the lives of families in south

It’s most famous interpreters are Gran Coquivacoa, Guaco and Maracaibo 15,
and the topics covered by this genre range from songs to love and religious
figures to humorous themes and denunciations. The political element is also
the protagonist of many issues.

It was executed initially with cuatro, furro, tambora, charrasca and
maracas. Soon they added the bass, the piano, the electric guitar, the
congas, the bongo, the cowbell and even brass (trumpet, trombone and
saxophone) and drums.

Although the Gaita was born as a folkloric expression, it&#8217;s evolution
became at the beginning of the 70’s a Latin style influenced by Caribbean
music, especially salsa and merengue. Most of the Gaita music that was
recorded can be registered in the Latin genre.

Carnavalesca, also called &#8220;Marchinha de Carnaval&#8221; or simply
&#8220;Marchinha&#8221; is one of several genres of music typical of urban
Carnival in southeast region of Brazil.

Regularly played by a solo vocalist or choir accompanied by a band of brass
and percussion, the lyrics / themes were mostly comic, satirical and spicy,
ironizing the conservative behavior and politics of everyday life.

Initially composed to be played and sung in the carnival blocks that paraded
through the streets of the cities, they were adopted as soundtracks for the
carnival balls in closed halls, called &#8220;Bailes de Carnaval&#8221;.

Because of the simplicity of the lyrics, almost always in one or two verses
and chorus, most of the recordings were made in the form of medleys,
grouping several songs into few tracks, as played on the balls.

The first Marchinha was the composition (in 1899) of Chiquinha Gonzaga
entitled &#8220;O Abre Alas,&#8221; made to the Cordão Carnavalesco
&#8220;Rosa de Outro.&#8221;

The most famous song in style is &#8220;Cidade Maravilhosa,&#8221; the
official anthem of Rio de Janeiro, composed in 1934 by André Filho.</span>

Criolla or Canción Criolla is a varied genre of Peruvian music that exhibits
influences from African, European, and Andean music. The genre&#8217;s name
reflects the coastal culture of Peru, and the local evolution of the term
criollo into a more socially inclusive element of the nation.

Afro-Peruvian music was first created by African slaves in Peru during the
Colonial Period and beyond. The rhythms include Festejo, Landó, Socabon,
Pregon, Zamacueca, and Alcatraz. Many of those were played with a mixture of
Spanish and Indian instruments and used the Spanish coplas as lyrics. They
were practiced only in private black gatherings until the 1950s, when
efforts of some scholars studying the Peruvian community, such as Lucha
Reyes, Nicomedes Santa Cruz, Victoria Santa Cruz and Jose Durand, compiled
songs and dances after struggling with racism and poor recognition.
Interpreters such as Lucila Campos, Caitro Soto, Susana Baca, Eva Ayllon,
and the Peru Negro dance company, among others, have brought these genres to
the world&#8217;s attention.

The most popular dance themed movement of música criolla in Perú is the
marinera, often called the national dance of Perú. Other main dance themed
movements are the Peruvian vals and tondero, festejo, polka, zamacueca,
coplas de amor fino, and landó. Peru&#8217;s national Día de la Canción
Criolla takes place on October 31.

is a popular dance music that initially arose in New York City during the
1960s. Salsa is the product of various musical genres including the Cuban
son montuno, guaracha, cha cha chá, mambo, and to a certain extent bolero,
and the Puerto Rican bomba and plena. Latin jazz, which was also developed
in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers, piano
guajeos, and instrumental soloists. Salsa is primarily Cuban son, itself a
fusion of Spanish canción and guitar and Afro-Cuban percussion, merged with
North American music styles such as jazz. Salsa also occasionally
incorporates elements of rock, R&#038;B, and funk. All of these non-Cuban
elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when
performed within the context of salsa.</span></li>

the Spanish guitar. On the other hand, its characteristic clave rhythm, call
and response structure, and percussion section (bongo, maracas, etc.) are
all rooted in traditions of Bantu origin.

or Tex-Mex music (Texan-Mexican music) is the name given to various forms of
folk and popular music originating among the Mexican-American populations of
Central and Southern Texas. With roots in the late 19th century, it became a
music genre with a wider audience in the late 20th century thanks to artists
such as Selena, often referred to as &#8220;The Queen of Tejano&#8221;,
Mazz, Elida Reyna, Los Palominos, Ramón Ayala, Elsa García, Laura Canales,

**Origins**

Europeans from Germany (first during Spanish time and 1830s), Poland, and
what is now the Czech Republic migrated to Texas and Mexico, bringing with
them their style of music and dance. They brought with them the waltz,
polkas and other popular forms of music and dance. However it was not until
the Mexican Revolution (1910–1917) that forced many of these Europeans to
flee Mexico and into South Texas, that their musical influence was to have a
major impact on Tejanos.

At the turn of the century, Tejanos were mostly involved in ranching and
agriculture. The only diversion was the occasional traveling musician who
would come to the ranches and farms. Their basic instruments were the flute,
guitar, and drum, and they sang songs that were passed down through the
generations from songs originally sung in Mexico. One of these musicians was
Lydia Mendoza, who became one of the first to record Spanish language music
as part of RCA&#8217;s expansion of their popular race records of the 1920s.
As these traveling musicos traveled into areas where the Germans, Poles, and
Czechs lived, they began to incorporate the oom-pah sound into their music.
Narciso &#8220;El Huracan del Valle&#8221; Martinez, known as the father of
conjunto music, defined the accordion&#8217;s role in conjunto music.

Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional
forms such as the corrido and mariachi, and Continental European styles,
such as polka, introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th
century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians
at the turn of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for
amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico. Small bands known as
orquestas, featuring amateur musicians, became a staple at community dances.

Norteño/conjunto accordion pioneer Narciso Martínez learned many tunes from
German and Czech brass bands and transposed them to his accordion. Martínez
gave accordion playing a new virtuosity in the 1930s, when he adopted the
two button row accordion. At the same time, he formed a group with Santiago
Almeida, a bajo sexto player. Their new musical style, known as conjunto,
soon became the popular music of the working class Tejano. Flaco Jiménez
carried on Martinez&#8217;s tradition of accordion virtuosity and became a
fixture on the international World Music scene by the 1980s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, rock and roll and country music made inroads, and
electric guitars and drums were added to conjunto combos. Also, performers
such as Little Joe added both nuances of jazz and R&#038;B, and a Chicano
political consciousness. During the 1970s, the music was known as &#8220;La
Onda Chicana;&#8221; it was later rebranded as &#8220;la Onda Tejana&#8221;
in the late 1980s-90s.

The 1960s and 1970s brought a new fusion of cultures and the first La Onda
Tejana Broadcasters. Popular Tejano musician and producer Paulino Bernal of
the Conjunto Bernal discovered and introduced to the Tejano music scene the
norteño band Los Relampagos Del Norte with Ramon Ayala and Cornelio Reyna on
his Bego Records. Ayala still enjoys success on both sides of the border.
Reyna enjoyed a very successful career as an actor and singer and resurfaced
in the Tejano scene with a major hit with his collaboration with Tejano
artist La Mafia. He toured constantly until his death. In the 1960s and
1970s, the first La Onda Tejana broadcasting pioneers hit the airwaves
including Marcelo Tafoya (first recipient of the Tejano Music Awards
&#8220;Lifetime Achievement Award), Mary Rodriguez, Rosita Ornelas, and Luis
Gonzalez, shortly followed by an influx of broadcasters including the Davila
family of San Antonio. This central Texas support by popular broadcasters
helped fuel La Onda.

La Onda continued to surge in the early to mid-1980s with the fusion
progression of tejano music coming to the forefront regionally with
&#8220;tejano ballads&#8221; like Espejismo&#8217;s hit &#8220;Somos Los
Dos&#8221;, written and sung by McAllen native Rudy Valdez, and La Sombra
with their Tex-Mex English &#038; Spanish brand of tejano. As the 1990s
dawned, La Mafia, already holding over a dozen Tejano Music Awards,
originated a new tejano style later to become a tejano standard. La Mafia
combined a pop beat to the popular Mexican cumbia and achieved success never
before seen in the tejano industry, becoming the first tejano artist to sell
over one million albums with Estas Tocando Fuego in 1992. With extensive
touring from as early as 1988, they eventually opened the doors for such
artists as Selena, Emilio Navaira, Jay Perez, and Grupo Mazz. Electronic
instruments and synthesizers increasingly dominated the sound, and tejano
music increasingly appealed to bilingual country and rock fans. In the wake
of her murder, Selena&#8217;s music received attention from a mainstream
American audience as well. Selena, known as &#8220;Queen of Tejano
Music&#8221;, became the first female tejano artist to win a Grammy and her
Ven Conmigo became the first tejano album by a female artist certified gold.

Since 1998, tejano has seen a decline of dedicated radio stations across the
USA, due to several factors. Among these is the success of Intocable. As a
result, many radio stations across the U.S., especially in Texas, have
converted to Norteño/Banda. This has caused tejano internet radio to become
popular.

recording is a style of non-music. Field recordings are audio recordings of
sounds, often non-musical, but music can be recorded as well. Artists of
this style typically have zero involvement with the sound of the piece, they
are simply recording &#8220;the field&#8221;. Field recordings can be of
nature (bird songs, rain, the ocean, etc), of locations (markets, factories,
restaurants, etc), of events (parades, family gatherings, etc), and
countless other subjects.

Field recordings can also include recordings of electrical systems, space
noise, and so on. Field recordings can also be musical if the subject is of
music; but only when the field recorder is recording music that they
themselves are not involved in. Artists such as [a=Kink Gong] are well known
for their musical field recordings. If the field recorder is involved in the
music they are recording, it is no longer a field recording, but special
exceptions do occur (such as an artist field recording themselves playing
with toy instruments with their child).

An alternate name of field recording is phonography, the sound equivalent of
photography. In the case of field recordings, typically it is of things the
artist is not directly involved in. Or if the artist is involved it is
naturally occurring sounds such as movement, talking, eating, and so on. The
concept of field recording being &#8220;sound photography&#8221; should help
you know when to apply this style tag and when to not.</span></li>

songs, more formally known as Hindi film songs or filmi songs, are songs
featured in Bollywood films. Derived from the song-and-dance routines common
in Indian films, Bollywood songs, along with dance, are a characteristic
motif of Hindi cinema which gives it enduring popular appeal, cultural value
and context.

Linguistically, Bollywood songs tend to use a colloquial dialect of
Hindi-Urdu, or Hindustani, mutually intelligible to both Hindi and Urdu
speakers, while modern Bollywood songs also increasingly incorporate
elements of Hinglish. Urdu poetry has had a particularly strong impact on
Bollywood songs, where the lyrics draw heavily from Urdu poetry and the
ghazal tradition. In addition, Punjabi is also occasionally used for
Bollywood songs.

Bollywood music covers a variety of styles and covers almost all styles of
formal music which would include, Rock, Pop, Classical and Traditional. Most
of the older films’ songs were sung in the Traditional Ragas and contributed
heavily to its longevity. Today the styles have been westernised to cater to
the younger audiences, but the traditional elements still remain.

Instrumentation-wise, Bollywood music still contain majority of the
traditional classical instruments like Sitar, Santoor, Tabla etc yet the
versatility of these instruments also translates very well into the western
styles of music. Fusion music between western and eastern instruments
already occurred through the 1950’s and was met with great appreciation.

(演歌) was originally used to refer political protest songs from the late 19th
century; however, from the 1960s onwards, it has referred to Japanese
popular music in a minor key, sung with no accompaniment, in a
&#8220;melisma&#8221; style (where a single syllable of text is sung while
moving between several different notes in succession). In Japanese, this
vocal style is known as &#8220;kobushi&#8221;. To put it more simply, it
means that the pitch of the singer&#8217;s voice fluctuates irregularly;
this compares with vibrato, which vibrates in a perfectly regular cycle.

limited to enka, as it can also be heard in the Italian song &#8220;Santa

and big band, as well as drawing on Japanese musical traditions. Koga Masao,
a very popular and influential composer primarily active in the late 1930s
and 40s, began to include Buddhist &#8220;shoumyou&#8221; chanting style
vocals into his songs, because his record label asked him to produce more
popular music; this shoumyou-type vocal is kobushi-like. As the nascent
genre developed, however, the vocals moved away from shoumyou and more
towards the &#8220;modern&#8221; type of kobushi.

The Western music scale has 7 notes, the well-known
&#8220;Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti&#8221;, but the native Japanese scale only has
5: &#8220;Do-Re-Mi-So-La&#8221;. For this reason, the Japanese scale can be
referred to as &#8220;ヨナ抜き&#8221; (Yona-nuki : &#8220;Yo&#8221; means 4,
&#8220;Na&#8221; means 7, &#8220;Nuki&#8221; means &#8220;without&#8221;):
it means that notes four and seven in the western scale are
&#8220;removed&#8221;.

Throughout the 1950s-1970s, artists like Misora Hibari, Kitajima Saburou,
solidified enka&#8217;s place in Japanese pop music (sometimes with songs
that had to be retroactively labelled &#8220;enka&#8221;), but past the
1970s, enka&#8217;s market share dropped off significantly, even as notable
artists continued to make hits in the 80s and beyond.

Often confused for Enka are related genres like &#8220;盛り場ポップス&#8221;
(sakariba pops / bar pops) and &#8220;ムード歌謡&#8221; (mood kayou). Some labels
even tried to push these (often short-lived) subgenres as a marketing
strategy. RCA and Nippon Crown were particularly known for this; RCA pushed
Fuji Keiko, Uchiyamada Hiroshi &#038; his Cool Five, and Kaji Meiko as
&#8220;enka&#8221; artists, although strictly speaking, they were singing
enka-influenced kayoukyoku songs. (Not that most people are particularly
bothered.) Another similar genre is the nagashi-uta, a subgenre of songs
with darker themes which is also influenced by traditional Japanese music;
this made a resurgence with the popularity of folk-rock in the 1960s and
70s.

Other musically-related kanji that are pronounced &#8220;enka&#8221;
occasionally confuse the naive reader as well. &#8220;艶歌&#8221; means
&#8220;sexy, bewitching, voluptuous&#8221; and is occasionally used in
easy-listening &#8220;pornogroove&#8221; type kayoukyoku albums (which are
often enka-influenced, but usually lacking kobushi vocal style, or any
vocals at all). &#8220;怨歌&#8221; is rarely used, but it means
&#8220;resentment song&#8221;; the resentment song has very dark or negative
themes, and is enka-styled, but may or may not fall under the formalistic
enka umbrella. The &#8220;resentment song&#8221; was very popular during the
60s and 70s as an expression of the rage of Japanese youth against the
Japan-US Security Treaty and the Vietnam War. A third set of kanji is
&#8220;援歌&#8221; or &#8220;cheer song&#8221;, which is generally enka-like,
but sung in an upbeat major key and at a faster &#8220;marching&#8221; style
tempo, and often with backup singers, like Suizenji Kiyoko&#8217;s
&#8220;三百六十五歩のマーチ&#8221;.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>J-pop</span><span
class='gsl-title'>29,349 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>J-pop is not
a technical term indicating the structure of music and sound style. J-pop is
Japanese pop music after Shōwa era (AD 07 Jan 1989). In around 1993 when
this term became popular it mainly refers to dance music.

&#8220;J-pop&#8221; is not simply shorthand for &#8220;Japanese Pop&#8221;
&#8211; rather, it is a term that started to be used around 1990, and has
since come to be applied to most popular music sung in Japanese using
contemporary instrumentation and recording techniques, though the term is
usually applied to more dance-oriented music.

The term was coined by record companies in order to describe the changing
nature of the Japanese music business, and to replace the older terms
Kayōkyoku (歌謡曲) and Shōwa Kayō (昭和歌謡) (&#8216;Shōwa&#8217; being the name of
the era corresponding to the reign of the Shōwa Emperor, 25 Dec 1926 to 07
Jan 1989).

As the Shōwa era changed to the succeding Heisei era, the Japanese music
market was at the same moment shifting from vinyl records to CDs as the
primary music format. This change of era, along with stylistic and marketing
changes in the Japanese music industry, prompted the need for a new term.
After the Shōwa Emperor&#8217;s death on January 7, 1989, Most industries in
Japan have been subject to mourning and refrained from selling. the market
for popular music &#8212; and particularly upbeat danceable music &#8212;
became subdued; this effect lasted well into the summer of 1989, when dance
tunes gradually made the market active again.

At this time, the Tokyo-based radio station J-Wave popularized the term
&#8220;J-pop&#8221; and helped it become widespread.
Although J-wave played only Japanese dance music, it diffused the new term
&#8220;J-pop&#8221; and helped promote it in the wider Asian market.
This followed a pattern which began around the same period of using
&#8220;J&#8221; to identify Japan and Japanese products, for example, the
J-League (Japan Professional Football League &#8211; 1993), JT (Japan
Tobacco &#8211; 1985), JR (Japan Railways Group- 1987), amongst others.
J-wave diffused a new technical term &#8220;J-pop&#8221; which a music genre
after 1990. but it was not immediately packaged for their products.

In the feverish climate of the Japanese asset price bubble (1986-1992), the
Japanese music market made these dance tunes called J-pop a symbol of the
prosperity of the Japanese economy.
In 1993, Tower Records Japan created a dedicated section in its shops for
J-pop, and its subsequent popularity cemented the term in common use at home
and abroad.

The success of genre J-pop has meant that, even now, Japanese major record
companies tend to abuse the term to sell related Japanese music products.
There has been confusion in the market due to the ever-expanding scope of
the term. Japanese major record companies will often label older music
&#8220;J-pop&#8221; to help the sale of back-catalog titles (which is
becoming an increasingly large part of the market).
This has created resistance amongst people who want Shōwa period music to be
recognised in its own right, and not incorporated &#8216;ex post
facto&#8217; into an amorphous concept of J-pop. That meant a departure from
the Showa era. It divided people of the Showa era and young dance pop
fans.Those who rely on Showa&#8217;s pop music thereby want to incorporate
it into J-pop, but that is a mistake.

Japan has a different culture and history than the Western market. the
Japanese market has big wholesale companies. 星光堂 (Seikodo), WINT (日本レコード販売網
JARECS, Lilac trading).
The retailers must go through either wholesale company. If the retailer does
not pass the wholesale company, the retail store can not purchase the record
/ CD released by the major company. Japanese wholesaler has not sales
division / category for J-pop in 1989. Naturally Japanese major companies
did not even have a sales strategy for J-pop for retailers. They did not
have the technical term J-pop for that. Physically J-pop can not exist on
products before 1990.
To put it briefly, since the summer of 1989, J-wave spread the terminology
of J-pop for dance music, However it shared
the ambiguous outline of J-pop in the consciousness of Japanese listeners,
It was in 1990.

So the concept of J-pop was born after the summer of 1989 that J-wave
announced &#8220;J-pop&#8221; for spread immediately in the Asian market.
but in 1993 J-pop products began to spread for sale. J-pop cannot exist on
original time of the vinyl record release before 1990. J-pop does not exist
on the vinyl record and tracks of vinyl record era. This sources: Recording
Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) and Japan Record Commerce Association,
JASRAC.

The term has spawned similar descriptors K-Pop (Korea) and C-Pop (China) or
Canto-Pop (Hong Kong)

instrumental, light music is also sometimes called concert music or mood
music. While it originates in the 18th and 19th century, the style of light
music has been referred to as such since the end of WWII and the beginning
of the 1950&#8217;s. Since then, it has been flourishing as a specific
style.
Considered to be especially played and appreciated in Western countries
(Europe, US&#8230;), light music is so-called not only for its
easy-listening side, but also because it is considered as less technical and
much more accessible to a broader audience than other forms of music such as
the symphony or the concerto.
Media such as the radio or the television have widely contributed to the
success of the style, with for instance the BBC broadcasting light music on
a regular basis in the mid-20th century. Examples of artists and composers
typical of light music include Franck Pourcel, Percy Faith, Mantovani,
Charles Ancliffe, Ronald Binge, Eric Coates, Frederic Curzon, Trevor Duncan,
Robert Farnon, Adalgiso Ferraris, Ron Goodwin, Albert Ketèlbey, Billy
Mayerl, Angela Morley, Ernest Tomlinson, Sidney Torch, Edward White, Charles

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Schlager</span><span
class='gsl-title'>174,026 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Schlager is
the German word for &#8220;Hit&#8221;, initially it has the same meaning, a
big success.
Later &#8220;Schlager&#8221; became the term for a kind of easy listening
pop music, trying to please most people as possible in German speaking
countries and Benelux.

In &#8220;Schlager&#8221; nearly all kinds of music styles are possible.
Songs from the musical genres Country, Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll, Pop, Swing
(and in few cases Hard Rock) counts as Schlager, when the English lyrics are
exchanged by German or Dutch. Also in the other direction, where a Schlager
became with English lyrics a pop song. Would the Band ABBA sung their songs
in German, this music would count as Schlager.
Much Schlagers are from USA, UK, other European countries, especially
Netherlands, in some cases the German version is more popular, than the
original.
By the way, German Schlagers were exported, much of the Dutch Schlagers are
German Schlagers with Dutch Lyrics. Few German Schlagers became successfull
in the USA.

Some Schlager songs are sentimental. Some Schlager songs refers to German
folk and German drinking songs. Some Schlager songs are arrangements of
classical music.

Schlager songs were very popular from the 1920&#8217;s till the
1970&#8217;s. In this time, songs in German language almost counts as
Schlager. This changed in the 1980&#8217;s, where the &#8220;New Wave&#8221;
reached Germany and much bands began to sing in German, this was called
&#8220;Neue Deutsche Welle&#8221; and was beside singer/songwriters the
first German music without the &#8220;Schlager&#8221; label. Germany&#8217;s
answer to &#8220;New Wave&#8221; lasts few years, but was door opener and
encouraging much bands to sing in German. And today it&#8217;s common, that
Germany has much different music in German language that isn&#8217;t seen as
Schlager.

In East Germany it was different. There was the rule &#8220;When you want to
sing on a record, you have to sing German&#8221;, so in East Germany was a
German pop music beside Schlager, long before West-Germany discovered this
way.

Much Schlagers of today are in the style of electronic Dance music
&#8220;Disco Fox&#8221;.

Arrangement and orchestration: Many things are possible, from a small band
with drums, bass and two guitars to a big orchestra with brass and strings.
Most songs are sung, most of them by one main singer, some with two main
singers, often some accompaniment by a choir and in few cases a choir as the
main singers. In the 1980&#8217;s they began to use electronic instruments
and sequencers more and more frequently.

In the 1970&#8217;s, there were TV shows and sampler records containing
both, German Schlager and English Pop music, this was possible and worked.
The famous German TV show &#8220;hitparade im ZDF&#8221; showed the most
successful pop songs in German language, till the coming of &#8220;Neue
Deutsche Welle&#8221; this were Schlagers. It was a show, where the vocal
performance had to be live, accompanied by tapes with the orchestral backing
from the original recording. Later they tried to open the show to other
music from Germany in English language and also the use of full playback, so
the vocal performance was prerecorded. Few years later, they turned back to
semi playback and German language. But in the 1990s Schlager wasn&#8217;t so
much popular anymore, so the show &#8220;hitparade&#8221; wasn&#8217;t
continued.

At least, Schlager was a collective term for different kinds of pop music
with German lyrics.</span></li>

class='gsl-title'>447,507 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Although
nearly all pop music involves sung vocals, in Vocal pop music, there is an
exceptional emphasis on a virtuosic, solo vocal performance which carries
almost the entire melody. The backing music is often a relatively simple
accompaniment by chords in a lower register, although it can include lush
orchestral or big-band arrangements as well. Rhythm sections tend to be very
subdued, if present at all.

Record shops and collectors typically use the term Vocal in reference to
mainstream, &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;adult&#8221; English-language pop
music of the 1950s and 1960s: mainly ballads and standards which continue
the tradition of vocal jazz, without the improvisational elements. The
style&#8217;s peak coincided with the early rock &#038; roll era, after
which most Vocal pop became regarded as &#8220;easy listening&#8221; music,
but it continues to enjoy waves of popularity throughout the world to the
present day.

On Discogs, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the style, the Vocal tag is
not used so strictly. It is found on all kinds of pop releases from all
eras, whenever a vocal solo dominates the performance. However, it should
not be used on just any pop music with vocals. It is inappropriate for
especially highly rhythmic pop or music which is better tagged with a
regional style such as Chanson (French-language vocal pop) or a style under
the Folk, World &#038; Country genre.</span></li>

a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s.
Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots
style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of
the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a
new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and
Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent,
changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or
&#8220;ragga&#8221;) becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms.
(The word &#8220;bashment&#8221;, a term originating in the 1990s, was used
to describe a particularly good dance; for example &#8220;to go to a
bashment dance&#8221;. In the Dancehall vernacular, &#8220;bashment&#8221;
is therefore an adjective instead of a noun.)

class='gsl-label'>&#8220;Reggae&#8221; came into focus in Jamaica in 1968 as
a stage in a continuum of musical styles after ska and rock steady. These
were the first locally originated music forms in post-independence Jamaica.
The previously distinct colonial-era Jamaican music was known as mento,
which evolved from the music of 19th century French set dance called
quadrille, which was popular among the English ruling class in Jamaica.
Mento emerged as the &#8220;fifth figure&#8221; of quadrille and has an
important connection to reggae, specifically the rhythm pattern strummed on
the banjo in mento. The reintroduction of this rhythmic pattern helped move
rocksteady into a new identity as reggae. &#8220;Reggae&#8221; was initially
spelled &#8220;reggay&#8221; when it appeared on records. Singer Toots
Hibbert (of the Maytals) has explained the term reggay was an adaptation of
&#8216;streggay,&#8217; a derogatory reference to women. The drummer Leroy
Horsemouth Wallace has said the term was adapted from musician Alva Reggie
Lewis&#8217;s style of rhythm guitar.

Reggae become distinct for the rhythm guitar pattern described above, and
the guitar&#8217;s close relationship with an organ &#8216;shuffle&#8217;
attributed to keyboardist Glen Adams. The drums emphasized beats two and
four, as had rocksteady.

Reggae became the dominant popular music in Jamaica for the next twenty
years until the mid-1980s when it evolved rhythmically to the point that a
newly dominant pattern distinguished it as &#8220;dancehall.&#8221; An
additional point of transition from reggae to dancehall was the introduction
and popularity of computer programmed rhythms, which replaced what had been
live drums, bass and horns during reggae&#8217;s first 16-17 years.

As a marketing term, &#8216;reggae&#8217; has been used, misleadingly, as a
catchall for all Jamaican music and other Carribean music.

music that evolved from ska in late 1966 and had it&#8217;s glory until 1968
when it lay the ground to, and was replaced with, reggae. Even if rocksteady
is the successor to ska the differences are striking. Rocksteady is slower,
more refined and cooler. The walking bassline that ska inherited from
R&#038;B changed and didn&#8217;t play on every beat with equal emphasis.
Instead it played a repeated pattern that syncopated the rhythm. Both the
bass and the drums plays a prominent role in rocksteady and it is sometimes
referred to as Jamaican drum and base. The style is also known as
&#8220;rock steady&#8221; (instead of rocksteady) which also referred to the
bass and the drums as a steady rock in the rhythm. The vocals are often
sweet, soulful and romantic.,

Some of the prominent producers during the short rocksteady era was Prince
Buster, Clement &#8220;Coxsone&#8221; Dodd and Duke Reid but the style also
opened the door to new producers as Joe Gibbs, Bunny Lee and Sonia Pottinger

rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a
genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of
the 1980s and became widely popular by the 1990s. The
&#8220;alternative&#8221; definition refers to the genre&#8217;s distinction
from mainstream rock music, expressed primarily in a distorted guitar sound,
subversive and/or transgressive lyrics and generally a nonchalant, defiant
attitude. The term&#8217;s original meaning was broader, referring to a
generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the
musical style, or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which
in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times,
&#8220;alternative&#8221; has been used as a catch-all description for music
from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for
any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock
(including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and
post-punk).

scenes of the previous decade and was heavily influenced by the British rock
bands of the 1960s, in particular The Beatles, The Kinks and The Small
Faces. It was seen as a backlash against American styles, most particularly
Grunge. Heavily melodic, with a traditional bass / guitar / drums /keyboard
lineuup, Oasis and Blur took the style around the world with much success.
It was, as a style, essentially finished by 2000.

is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its
earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the
United States and the UK around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by
the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and
Bob Dylan-penned material with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily
influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The term &#8220;folk
rock&#8221; was itself first coined by the U.S. music press to describe The
Byrds&#8217; music in June 1965, the same month that the band&#8217;s debut
album was issued. The release of The Byrds&#8217; cover version of
Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man&#8221; and its subsequent commercial
success initiated the folk rock explosion of the mid-1960s. Dylan himself
was also influential on the genre, particularly his recordings with an
electric rock band on the Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited,
and Blonde on Blonde albums. Dylan&#8217;s 25 July 1965 appearance at the
Newport Folk Festival with an electric backing band is also considered a
pivotal moment in the development of folk rock.

(or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With
roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal
developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified
distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.
Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are often associated with
masculinity, aggression, and machismo.

is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the
1980s. Indie rock is extremely diverse, with sub-genres that include indie
pop, jangle pop, C86, and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe
record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and
was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk
revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the
mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that
retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result
of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet,
a number of indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to
questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Krautrock</span><span
class='gsl-title'>21,936 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Krautrock is
a musical genre emerged in the late 1960s, mainly represented by groups from
West Germany. It is a general term used for bands playing experimental,
partly electronic type of music. Krautrock is originally a subgenre to the
progressive rock, but instead of adding components of jazz and classical
music (as happened in US and UK), the German musicians created a more
mechanical and electronic sound.

The word &#8220;krautrock&#8221; was coined by the English music press, and
was initially insulting as the word kraut was slang for a German person,
referring to the German dish &#8220;sauerkraut&#8221;. The negative
connotation dissappeared as the music made by these bands since then was
highly appreciated. Today, the word is honoring rather than insulting.

Typical krautrock bands in the early 1970s were Amon Düül II, Tangerine
Dream, Faust, Can and other bands associated with the Cologne-based producer
Conny Plank, like Neu!, Kraftwerk and Cluster. The composer Karlheinz
Stockhausen also had influence on this experimental scene.

The standards of lo-fi have evolved throughout the decades and the term

some older examples may not have been originally recognized as lo-fi, the

<a href='https://www.discogs.com/style/lounge'>
<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Lounge</span><span
class='gsl-title'>13,564 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Lounge music
is a type of easy listening music popular in the 1950s and 1960s. It may be
meant to evoke in the listeners the feeling of being in a place, usually
with a tranquil theme, such as a jungle, an island paradise or outer space.
The range of lounge music encompasses beautiful music–influenced
instrumentals, modern electronica (with chillout, and downtempo influences),
while remaining thematically focused on its retro-space-age cultural
elements. The earliest type of lounge music appeared during the 1920s and
1930s, and was known as light music. In the 21st century, the term lounge
music may also be used to describe the types of music played in hotels (the
lounge, the bar), casinos, supermarkets, several restaurants, and piano
bars.

**Retrospective usage**

Exotica, space age pop, and some forms of easy listening music popular
during the 1950s and 1960s are now broadly termed lounge. The term lounge
does not appear in textual documentation of the period, such as Billboard
magazine or long playing album covers, but has been retrospectively applied.

While rock and roll was generally influenced by blues and country, lounge
music was derived from jazz and other musical elements borrowed from
traditions around the world. Exotica from such artists as Les Baxter, Martin
Denny and Arthur Lyman sold millions of records during its heyday. It
combined music that was popular outside the USA, such as various Latin
genres (e.g., Bossa nova, Cha-Cha-Cha, Mambo as in Cal Tjader&#8217;s fine
Latin jazz efforts), Polynesian, French, etc. into a relaxed, palatable
sound. Such music could have some instruments exaggerated (e.g., a
Polynesian song might have an exotic percussion arrangement using bongos,
and vocalists imitating wild animals). Many of these recordings were
portrayed as originating in exotic foreign lands, but in truth were recorded
in Hollywood recording studios by veteran session musicians. Another genre,
space age pop, mimicked space age sound effects of the time and reflected
the public interest in space exploration. With the advent of stereophonic
technology, artists such as Esquivel used spatial audio techniques to full
effect, creating whooshing sounds with his orchestra.

Allmusic describes lounge as less &#8220;adventurous&#8221; than exotica or
space age pop, but not as &#8220;watered-down&#8221; as Muzak.
&#8220;Instead, it occupied the middle ground, appealing to fans of
traditional pop as well as space age pop.&#8221;

A good deal of lounge music was pure instrumental (i.e., no main vocal part,
although there could be minor vocal parts). Sometimes, this music would be
theme music from movies or TV shows, although such music could be produced
independently from other entertainment productions. These instrumentals
could be produced with an orchestral arrangement, or from an arrangement of
instruments very similar to that found in jazz, or even rock and roll such
as the Hammond Organ or electric guitar.

**Lounge singers**

&#8220;Swinging&#8221; music of the era is also considered
&#8220;lounge&#8221; and consisted of a schmaltzy continuation of the swing
jazz era of the 1930s and 1940s, but with more of an emphasis on the
vocalist. The legendary Rat Pack of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy
Davis Jr., along with similar artists such as Bobby Darin, Jackie Gleason,
Wayne Newton, Louis Prima, Sonny King, and Sam Butera are notable examples.
The music of Burt Bacharach was soon featured as part of many lounge
singers&#8217; repertoires. Such artists performed mainly at featured
lounges in Las Vegas casinos. Documented pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge
scene, the Mary Kaye Trio were first on the scene in the early 50&#8217;s.

Lounge singers have a lengthy history stretching back to the decades of the
early twentieth century. The somewhat derisive term lounge lizard was coined
then, and less well known lounge singers have often been ridiculed as
dinosaurs of past eras and parodied for their smarmy delivery of standards.
In any event, these lounge singers, perhaps performing in a hotel or
cocktail bar, are usually accompanied by one or two other musicians, and
they favor cover songs composed by others, especially pop standards, many
deriving from the days of Tin Pan Alley.

Many well-known performers got their start as lounge singers and musicians.
Although he claims not to have worked for very long, Billy Joel worked as a
lounge musician and penned the song &#8220;Piano Man&#8221; about his
experience. Not all lounge singers, however, sing lounge music.

**Resurgence**

Lounge emerged in the late 1980s as a label of endearment by younger fans
whose parents had listened to such music in the 1960s. It has enjoyed
resurgences in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, led initially by iconic
figures such as Buster Poindexter and Jaymz Bee. In Japan, producer Yasuharu
Konishi became popular for his work with Pizzicato Five, and is often
considered &#8220;the Godfather of Shibuya-kei,&#8221; a genre mostly
derived from 1960s lounge music.

In the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included such
groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Cocktails, Pink Martini, the
High Llamas, Don Tiki, and Nightcaps. Alternative band Stereolab
demonstrated the influence of lounge with releases like their 1993 EP Space
Age Bachelor Pad Music and their 1997 album Dots and Loops, and in 1996
Capitol Records began issuing the Ultra-Lounge series of lounge music
albums. The lounge style was starkly in contrast to the grunge music that
dominated the period. These groups wore suits and played music inspired by
earlier works of Antônio Carlos Jobim, Juan García Esquivel, Louis Prima and
many others.

In the 2000s Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine has added to this
resurgence by covering (usually profane) hit songs of other genres
(primarily metal and hip hop) in the style of a lounge singer. In 2004, the
Parisian band, Nouvelle Vague, released a self-titled album in which they
covered songs from the &#8217;80s post-punk and new wave genres in the style
of Bossa Nova. Other artists have taken lounge music to new heights by
recombining rock with pop, such as Jon Brion, The Bird and the Bee, Triangle
Sun, Pink Martini, the Buddha-Lounge series, and the surrounding regulars of
Café Largo. The movie The Rise and Fall of Black Velvet Flag (2003) is a
documentary about three older punk rockers who created a lounge-punk band.

**In film**

In the 1980 movie The Blues Brothers, most of the members of the band were
reduced to performing as &#8220;Murph and the Magictones&#8221; (headlining
at a Holiday Inn) after bandleader Jake Blues went to prison. When the band
takes a break to speak with Jake and his brother Elwood, Murph switches on a
Muzak version of &#8220;Just the Way You Are,&#8221; performed by Billy
Joel, a former lounge musician himself. Later, when Jake and Elwood are in
an elevator, Jobim&#8217;s &#8220;The Girl from Ipanema&#8221; is heard on
Muzak.

The 1989 film The Fabulous Baker Boys starred Jeff Bridges, Beau Bridges,
and Michelle Pfeiffer as a successful lounge act.

The film Swingers was set during the mid-1990s lounge and swing revival in
Los Angeles, and featured legendary performers like Dean Martin, Louis
Jordan and Tony Bennett, as well as modern lounge acts like Love Jones, Joey
Altruda and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

The soundtrack of the 1994 anthology film Four Rooms consists of lounge
music.

**Comedy**

Andy Kaufman created a character called Tony Clifton. A parody of show biz
entitlement and excess, Clifton is untalented, lazy (often not bothering to
remember the words to the songs), and abusive to his audiences. Bill Murray
also portrayed a particularly bad lounge singer on Saturday Night Live, Nick
The Lounge Singer, best known for providing his own lyrics to the John
Williams theme from Star Wars and performing an over-the-top version of the
Morris Albert hit &#8220;Feelings&#8221;. Later, Will Ferrell and Ana
Gasteyer portrayed a goofy married duo of lounge-style musicians, but in
unlikely venues such as high school dances. Part of the humor derived from
the incongruous application of their &#8220;nerdy&#8221; and outdated style
to performances of current pop-music hits. British comedians Mel Smith and
Griff Rhys Jones appeared as a cheesy keyboard and bass duo during the end
credits of one series of their long-running sketch show. Richard Cheese and
The Lounge Kittens specialize in playing lounge-style arrangements of recent
popular rock, metal and hip hop songs, sung in a croony traditional swing
vocal style, contrasting an elegant jazz treatment of the music with often
profane and ribald lyrics to create a humorous dissonance.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>New Wave</span><span
class='gsl-title'>163,575 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>New wave is
a genre of rock music and a term which became popular in the late 1970s and
the early 80s with connections to punk rock, disco, and electronic music.
New wave was a cultural shift away from the blues, classic rock, and
progressive rock sounds which were dominant in the early and mid 70s. The
term refers to both this shift and the great amount of cross pollination
happening in music in the late 70s when non-mainstream musicians began
incorporating a wide range of seemingly disparate sounds with a DIY rawness.
Early punk, dub reggae, funk, art rock, glam pop, kraut rock, and
experimental electronic music were all very influential on this new wave of
rock musicians. For a very short period in the 70s the term was
interchangable with Punk, especially in the US where the industry was wary
of the &#8220;punk fad&#8221;. There were also different usages in the UK
and the US mainstream media. Some music journalists consider New Wave to be
a genre that takes the energy and ethos of Punk and combines it with more
sonic and structural experimentation. Still, many consider New Wave to be
such a broad umbrella term that it loses any defining power, similar to
Alternative Rock which came later. As a result many artists and fans use
related subgenres like Synth-Pop, Post-Punk, Goth-Rock, New Romantic, and
Dark Wave to point to more specific qualities embodied in the diverse New
Wave sound. By the mid 80s the term was less frequently used by both the
music industry and journalists, but in the late 1990s and into the 21st
century a resurgence and nostalgia for popular 80s music has brought the
term back into popular usage. </span></li>

a derivation of Grindcore/Hardcore Punk. Has been use as a term since
mid/late 80’s and stabilized itself as a own genre.

The songs are usually chaotic short blasts of noise, accompanied by
screamed, growled, or shouted vocals. While there is some instrumental
variation (some groups use drum machines, others use completely non-musical
noise sources), Noisecore acts tend to use a guitar and/or bass guitar.

Earlier releases tagged as &#8220;Noisecore&#8221; tend to be a raw,
chaotic, and lo-fi form of Hardcore; artists in this style include
Tranquilizer (2), Kuolema, and Brigada Do Ódio.
Napalm Death&#8217;s &#8220;You Suffer&#8221; is generally considered the
blueprint for most later Noisecore, being approximately one second long.
Tracks can go to even couple dozen of seconds, but hardly ever reaches
length of 1 minute or so.
Typical Noisecore releases (whether singles or LPs) can contain forty or
more songs, with some releases claiming to contain thousands of tracks.

Lyrical content varies from highly political (Seven Minutes Of Nausea, Fear
Of God) to the gross/offensive (later Anal Cunt, Gore Beyond Necropsy) to
the absurd/surreal (Sore Throat, Minch); some acts (early Anal Cunt, Genital
Masticator, The Gerogerigege) use wordless vocal sounds.</span></li>

(originally called new musick) is a broad type of rock music that emerged
from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from the
simplicity and traditionalism of punk rock to adopt a variety of avant-garde
sensibilities. Inspired by punk&#8217;s energy and DIY ethic but determined
to break from rock cliches, artists experimented diversely with sources
including electronic music and black styles like funk, disco, dub, and free
jazz; novel recording and production techniques; and ideas from art and
politics, including critical theory, modernist art and literature.
Communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia
performances and fanzines developed around these pioneering musical scenes,
which coalesced in cities such as London, New York, Manchester, and San
Francisco.

The early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups such as Siouxsie and
the Banshees, Wire, Public Image Ltd, the Pop Group, Cabaret Voltaire,
Magazine, Pere Ubu, Gang of Four, Joy Division, Talking Heads, Throbbing
Gristle, the Slits, the Cure, the Fall and Au Pairs. The movement was
closely related to the development of ancillary genres such as gothic rock,
neo-psychedelia, no wave and industrial music. By the mid 1980s, post-punk
had dissipated while providing the impetus for the New Pop movement as well
much subsequent alternative and independent music.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Power Metal</span><span
class='gsl-title'>17,810 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Power metal
is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy
metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power
metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in
contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent for example in extreme
metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based
subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and
emotionally &#8220;powerful&#8221; sound.

The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two
different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in
North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more
widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia,
Germany, Greece, Spain and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and
Argentina) and East Asia with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use
of keyboards. </span></li>

rock is a rock music subgenre that originated in the United Kingdom and
United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. It developed from
psychedelic rock, and began as an attempt to give greater artistic weight
and credibility to rock music. Songs were replaced by musical suites that
often stretched to 20 or 40 minutes in length and contained symphonic
influences, extended musical themes, fantasy-like ambience and lyrics, and
complex orchestrations.</span></li>

<li class='gsl-release'><span class='gsl-artist'>Pub Rock</span><span
class='gsl-title'>4,330 Releases</span><span class='gsl-label'>Pub rock is a
rock music genre that was developed in the early to mid-1970s in the U.K. A
back-to-basics movement which incorporated roots rock, pub rock was a
reaction against expensively-recorded and produced progressive rock and
flashy glam rock. Although short-lived, pub rock was notable for returning
live rock to the small intimate venues (pubs and clubs) of its early years.
With pub rock&#8217;s emphasis on small venues, simple, fairly inexpensive
recordings and indie record labels, it was the catalyst for the development
of the British punk rock scene. By 1975, the standard for mainstream rock
album recordings was expensive, lengthy studio recording processes overseen
by highly-paid record producers, with the goal of creating highly polished
end products, with overdubs, double-tracking and studio effects. Some
mainstream bands spent months in the studio perfecting their recording, to
achieve a meticulously crafted and perfect product. Pub rockers rejected
this type of costly, complex recording process; instead, with pub rockers,
the goal was simply to capture the band&#8217;s &#8220;live&#8221; sound and
feel in the studio.

Australian Pub Rock is similar, hard rock, blues rock, and/or progressive
rock. It waspopular throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and still influencing
contemporary Australian music in the 2000s. The term came from the venues
where most of these bands originally played — inner-city and suburban pubs.
These often noisy, hot, small and crowded venues were not always ideal as
music venues and favoured loud, simple songs based on drums and electric
guitar riffs.Though Australia has a relatively small population, the
proportionally high number of venues that bands could play in, meant that a
band could tour extensively, often playing every night for long periods.
This would allow bands such as AC/DC, Cold Chisel, INXS, Midnight Oil, Rose
Tattoo and others to take their live skills into large venues in the US and
Europe with ease.</span></li>

(or &#8220;punk&#8221;) is a rock music genre that emerged in the mid-1970s
in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom / Western Europe, and
Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known
as &#8220;proto-punk&#8221; music, punk rock bands rejected perceived
excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced
songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down
instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk
embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them
through independent record labels. </span></li>
